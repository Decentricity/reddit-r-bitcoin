"February 09, 2015 at 02:51PM",Flame-Broiled,"Anyone think server issue was WAY more important in Silk Road trial? Why did Dratel not file, even after repeated attemps from the Judge when he knew the battle was lost? His negligence sealed his client's life sentence.","Here is my assessment, and granted, this is a board for me to hear your thoughts, reasons, theories, just anything...... WHY and how did this case get hacked so terribly? Help me understand why the lawyer didn't even attempt to file for ownership and stop this whole damned trial.My Response to being asked about server evidence:It was admitted by the judge and both parties that the search and seizure of the server, the basis for this entire case, was questionable at best in open court nonetheless. Only reason the defense's motion got thrown out was because Ulbricht's attorney refused to admit ownership of the server therefore making his 4th amendment rights null and void, as declared by the Judge. As the case proceeded and things were looking more and even more dire, she even asked the defense OVER and OVER if they would like to file a motion to declare ownership of the searched property, damned well knowing that the case would likely get thrown out if the d lawyer would just file the paperwork. The defense attorney, who is either the dumbest attorney practicing or the most ill-informed lawyer alive; both of which are unacceptable, thought that they had a chance without it, so decided not to file the paperwork of admission. Now he's going for appeals and will not be able to change Ulbricht's stance on owning the property. That ship has already sailed.... and sunk.FOOD FOR THOUGHT: The world's best white and black hat hackers were both attacking his server 24/7/365 for bragging rights (for the former) or the pot of free bitcoins (the latter). If you think that the fuzz just happened to be the only one to log in to just the right place at just the right time for just the right second to access just the right page to take down none other than, DPR, now synonymous with Ulbricht, you are.... idiotic.In essense, Ulbricht's lawyer booked him a one-way ticket on the Titanic by not allowing him to tell the court he did in fact own the damned server. This case would not be going forward had that been done. This whole thing makes me want to bang my head against a wall. Sad that his downfall had to be at the hands of an illegal hack, a shitty defense strategy, and other unnamed parties not playing fair ball. The way he was taken down by the fuzz is like the pot calling the kettle black.So yes, the server was 99.9ee% attained illegally and should be the whole topic of discussion moving forward. Forget the rest, this carriage of justice was carried out using blatantly illegal and unjust methods. +10 for the LE Team, -1000 for the American Public.I'm all for justice, but justice through means of injustice.... well that just sucks.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1yZoEQe
"February 09, 2015 at 03:54PM",Nabako,What happens the day all bitcoin got mined?,"First, we agree that mining refers to process used to verify bitcoin transactions on the blockchain. Then in return for verifying these transactions, miners are rewarded with new bitcoins.Today the main incentive is that only ~65% of all bitcoin have been mined. So miners are still rewarded. However, when the last bitcoin is mined, what would be the incentive for miners to continue mining? Huge electricity bills and not bitcoin to earn.Does that mean just few miners will continue their activity for the good of bitcoin even with costs and no rewards?Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but If difficulty to mine is related to the number of people mining, having less persons mining will also decrease the difficulty, so cost may decrease as well, no?Finally, if there are less miners, will verification time increase drastically? (Less miners, but hopefully more and more transactions)?Thx :)",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/16EuqyK

"February 09, 2015 at 08:19PM",RedGolpe,btc-minute to btc-year: introducing btc-time.,"We all know pretty well that the btc mining speed is adjusted every ""couple of weeks"" (2016 blocks) to keep new blocks around 10 minutes apart each other. That prompted me to define a btc-minute as 1/10 of the time between two contiguous blocks in the main chain. I then extend this concept defining the btc-week as half the time between two consecutive difficulty adjustments. Note that while there are exactly 10'080 minutes in a week, and 10'080 btc-minutes in a btc-week on average, there will be exactly 10'080 btc-minutes in a btc-week only if we start and end counting from a difficulty adjustment. This makes things even more interesting, because not only btc-minutes and btc-weeks have variable durations, but they are not even synchronized among themselves. Finally, I declare a btc-year as 1/4 of the time between two consecutive halvings of the mining reward. Note that while there are on average 52.1775 weeks in a year, there are only 52.0833 btc-weeks in a btc-year. This is only a minor nuisance, as the average btc-minute is already significantly shorter than the usual minute, so the btc-year will only be even a bit shorter.Now, there is no inherent need for a unit of time to be constant: while this may create unreasonable problems for every day life, it would make perfect sense in many, unexpected ways. For example, we notice that 2 contiguous blocks are always separated by exactly 10 btc-minutes: a neat semplification! Try to compute how many minutes have passed from the first block (mined at 18:15:05 UTC on January 3, 2009) until now: a daunting task! But we can easily say that being now at block 342,700 exactly 3,427,000 btc-minutes have passed, or 340 btc-weeks, or around 6 btc-years and a half. Also, when you call your gf and tell her ""I'll be there in 20 btc-minutes"" she has no way to tell when you are due unless the next three blocks are mined. Then, and only then, can she tell that you are late!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/16K4VN3

When i explained it how SHA works he objected that if the price is going at raise at huge levels, even only again at 1k$, company will invest more and more in ASIC and because the biggest pool will take the majority of share, even a pool at 40% (already happened) could kill all the other because the mined coins would not be enough to pay for energy, hardware and stuff.""I don't feel safe to hold in a market where someone could drop millions of share in a blink of an eye"" This came out talking about how the vast majority of bitcoin is holded by a minority of address. He said it's ok for a use, but holding a thing that could crash any time it's not for him. He knows that the fiat has the same flaw and he doesn't like it either, but there is no alternative.""Price fluctuation is too high"" Yadda yadda yadda, we all know this one""If something happen and it's banned i will lose all my money"" Self explanatory. He was particularly warried about the price drop that will follow the ban for sure.After an hour of chatting we came to the conclusion that the average joe wants a coin that: has a value not linked with the dollar, but to goods (not USA here, dollar fluctuation will affect us even using bitcoin, and this is a huge disadvantage for us), with less holders or at least known big holders (for a fact of trust, nothing more) and a better system of alias, because long address are not comfortable and if he has to relay on paypal-like service then it's useless to use bitcoin in everyday life.Opinions?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1DXsyMI

While there are great services out there(coinbase, buttercoin, trucoin), they are still centralized services.I'm looking forward to decentralized exchanges like coinffeine and bitsquare, but they're not really filling the blanks on how to pay someone with your CC or bank account for bitcoin. Each person using these services isn't a business, so they have to use some kind of p2p payment system.Note that this method I'm about to describe would only work for USD or credit card buyers of bitcoin.Venmo has the ability to do this. You can add your credit, debit, or bank account, and pay anyone USD. I could make a decentralized runnable application based on tomp2p(for the exchange), that uses your venmo account to pay anyone for BTC. They've got a full fledged OAuth api too.Let me know what you guys think about using something like this, and any potential caveats I might encounter.

When the guy has a bitcoin otc exchange and thousands thousands of coinsI think it's also that a lot of VC and entrepreneurs know that the price matters but they want to focus people's attention on other metrics because we are in the bear market. Imo it's a mistake. Sure it's easier to forecast wallet increases than price rise but instead of ignoring the price, they should explain that 200$ is high from $13 two years ago but low considering expectations.All these ecosystem metrics have only an interest in forecasting a future price rise. Bitcoin is a payment network that only works with its own digital commodity. The important thing is the commodity. It's the digital gold. The payment network can't work without the value but the value can increases by a few order of magnitudes without the payment network becoming a big thing. It just needs to be easier to move than gold and it's already a million time easier to move than gold. There is no need for any killer app whatsoever. Secure exchanges and wallets are what's needed. Bitcoin is not about cutting the middleman either, just making it easier to be a middleman. Most people should in fact stick to a middlemen cause they won't be able to do it properly by themselves.That's something people fail to recognize. Bitcoin has only two class of competitors: Gold and Altcoins. Not Fiat. And it's all about the price.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/16IfnUM

There would be a client that people could run on their machines. These people are the shareholders. Customers of the DAC could send a message to the client and some bitcoin and get a random number back. All the bitcoin send to the DAC would be redistributed to its shareholders in return for running the client.Now some questions: 1) What would be the best way of distributing the revenues of the DAC to its shareholders? 2) Would the DAC create it's own blockchain or leverage the bitcoin blockchain? 3) What would be the best way to limit the shareholders (as revenue gets diluted as more shareholders join) while at the same time keep enough critical mass?Thanks guys in advance in helping getting my head around this topic.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1zEfEnq

However, I am skeptical as a buy-in price makes your money immediately take on a loss (if the price remains stable which is the the hallmark of any adopted currency, which is the stated goal) & another price is also occurred via opting to change Bitcoin back into your local currency with exchanges. So, if I converted $1000 into Bitcoin then soon after wanted to convert it back if I am in need & have no other savings, I have just taken on a loss of $30 without doing anything. This plus downward movement in price may make this problem worse, lack of retrieval if you have lost your password, being scammed etc. It has got quite a few hiccups to overcome to reach widespread appeal & these may be on the minds on many individuals thinking about Bitcoin.

You can choose your chances ranging from 0.01% chance with a 9,900 multiplier on your BTCs you're betting, to a 98% chance with a 1.01 multiplier on your BTCs you're betting.Now, it doesn't take someone stupid to realize that this isn't worth it. The house has a 0.5% advantage, meaning overal you're not likely to make profit off this.But I was thinking, if you happened to have, let's say, 5 bitcoins on you, and you were to deposit them into PrimeDice (pretty risky, but just talking hypothetically). Then you made your chances 98% and bet all of them in. You would gain 0.05 bitcoin, or $11.10.This brings up my point, to if you were to be the top 100th biggest bitcoin owner ever, currently with 10,000 bitcoins, you could earn 100 bitcoins off doing this method (let's hope you're not that 2% that loses 2.2 million $ worth of BTC). 100 bitcoins currently = $22,203.$22,203 for really doing almost nothing. Of course you're totally risking your 10,000 bitcoins (lol), but if you were to do this. I'm pretty sure PrimeDice is very trusted. I saw one person win 18 bitcoins in the High Rollers section.

(If you have a question about Bitcoin and I know the answer - feel free to ask - I would love to share my knowledge).I want to fight for the right for Bitcoin to exist before something bad happends to Bitcoin by people in power - by the people in power who are running the large mining pools by themselfs for their own greed and good without sharing the knowledge to everyone else all around the world. It is only allowed because people don't really know what Bitcoin is.Children and people all around the world are starving day by day while people in power are making huge amounts of money without giving back to the poor. I don't believe that is fair because I know it's not. And now they took Bitcoin from us!As I've understood it, by following mainstream media, the understanding of what Bitcoin is and how Bitcoin works is not there by common man. And also by reading on other subs here on Reddit I've seen the corruption and greed by the people in power - how they are taking without giving back to the poor and how the people in power are exploating the poor for their own greed without giving back to the poor and without anyone caring. That's not right. I don't know when this started to happen but it should not be like this. It's not what people really want. It sure as hell is not fair.The poor just don't have the power or knowledge on how to speak their voices. I want to be that voice. Something is wrong on how people think and perceive corruption and greed and it needs to be fixed. So I will do it.So I will fight in court to prevent greed and corruption keeping on and spreading more and more by the current people in power. I want to go to court and be part of making new laws for the benefit of Bitcoin so we can prevent greed and corruption. I want everyone to own Bitcoin.We need laws taking care of people who are corrupt and greedy, preventing them from things like double-spending and taking advantage of the blockchain. I am sure I've missed other greedy things done by people in power that I don't quite understand right now.I want to be a part of those people who are going to stand up and fight for the right of Bitcoin.

It is probably totally irrelevant so my apologies if it seems stupid.Increasing the block size is a good idea and necessary, imo. But is it enough? What bothers me is the average 10 minutes time needed to find a new block. This makes validating a transaction quite slow (between 10 and 50 mins depending on the number of validations needed).What would be the downsides of speeding up this block discovery time? Let's say we make it so a block is found every 60 seconds instead of 10 minutes, and the reward per block is reduced accordingly. Sure this would mean a hard fork but would there be other issues that I don't see?What I really appreciate with an altcoin (that I won't name here) is the incredibly fast transaction validation time: 24 seconds. This means that a new block is being generated every 24 seconds. This with an increased block size makes it very fast and scalable.Anyone knows why this isn't even a considered option for Bitcoin?Sorry for this newbie question!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1CcqBd4

That's what stops me from running one, knowing that I could sustain it for a short duration and nothing but a cost to me and have to drop it from the network as soon as I needed more memory and power for said drives.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1CdpfyL

"February 10, 2015 at 11:47PM",oh_shit_hes_right,The blocksize won't change from 1MB even if everyone wants it to.,"The final panic for bitcoin happens when the masses realize that if you don’t buy first, you won’t get to use the mystical blockchain. Ever. This panic will happen after it is made clear that the block size is not changing from 1MB and outsiders fully swallow the situation.Bitcoin does not give a flying fuck about you. Not one fuckity fuck. It doesn’t care about anyone except those who hold it - proportional to how much they hold. It is an immortal beast that will outlive the human race. It may even destroy the human race. It always moves in the way that is desired by the investors, even if that means pain for everyone else not involved. Bitcoin belongs to those who hold the private key. The masses believe that if bitcoin catches on they will follow suit and get to use the awesome blockchain. Wrong.Sorry bitches, you don’t get to use it unless you can pay the fucking transaction fee. Let me break it down for you so you understand what that means. Right now BTC is at ~$220 / 1 BTC and the minimum transaction fee is .0001 BTC, so 2 cents per transaction. As bitcoin grows in price, so does the minimum amount of money required to put a transaction on the network. Do the math and you get to see how many trades you’re fucking allowed to do on the blockchain. (Pro tip it’s a lot fucking easier to do the math by keeping all units in bitcoin.)As the price of bitcoin rises it becomes impractical for the masses to use the blockchain for their everyday transaction and then quickly it becomes impractical for them to use the blockchain for any transaction. They will desperately fight to increase the block size so they can participate but holders of bitcoin will refuse. If the masses try to fork the blockchain holders will dump their coins on the new chain and use the proceeds to rebuy the coins on the old chain.Neither satoshi nor gavin can save you.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/17akb6C
"February 10, 2015 at 11:42PM",Imperatorny,2015 is the year of Bitcoin going Mainstream.,"Up until 2 weeks ago, I was the only person holding bitcoins among my friends. My background is in online gambling, and I have been involved in bitcoin for the past 2 years.What happened recently:Early in Jan one of my friends called me, and he asked me 'how can I invest in bitcoins?'. We started talking and he came up with the conclusion he should and will buy some bitcoins from Bitstamp. However, he did not have enough funds, as he would get paid by his company in 2 weeks time. He didn't want to miss the 'cheap' coins in January, so he went to his boss for a loan. Once his boss heard about bitcoin, suddenly he thought it is a good investment. So the very next day, his boss bought coins for 5k, the money he would have lended to my friend to buy coins for himself. A week later my friend bought his coins, and a week later both his boss and my friend doubled up on their investment. Both their background is in business (tire shop manager & owner).At the same time, another friend of mine called me, asking about how he can securely buy bitcoins for his mother, as she read about it somewhere and wanted to keep some as a long term investment. I explained him an he bought for her, and he bought for himself too. He plays poker for a living. and his mother works at a Library.Last week I had 3 of my childhood friends came by and we spoke at lenght about bitcoins. After they watched the video about the Chinese bitcoin mine, all three of them created their first wallets, and bought some bitcoins. One of them works at an airport, another one is a bartender and the third one is a receptionist.Afterwards, another, totally unrelated to any of my other contacts, person contacted me, since he is launching a bitcoin binary options website, to seek advice. His background is in online customer support.While communicating with all these people, my best man created a bitcoin wallet and is now holding some bitcoins, he is a director of a tobacco company.And we have most likely created the world's first bitcoin beggar - another unemployed friend of ours, who doesn't stop bothering us on facebook for bitcoins after we sent him some to player poker. :)So given all these people, and their backgrounds and various age, and given that we are not even talking about the US here, but about a small town in the eastern part of Bulgaria...Are we going Mainstream in 2015 or what???",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1zHbxag

I was recently looking at some of my transactions, I notice a VERY high miner fee. The transaction in question is this one http://ift.tt/1z4Lc29 thought I was sending a buddy 1.1 BTC (which is what he got) but in looking at the details, there was 0.09511953 extra (~$21) for the mining fee (I think).I sent the BTC using the blockchain Iphone wallet, to his blockchain wallet. No where on the app do I see where you can change the mining fee. I guess I always assumed it was .002 (~$.46). But in looking at the fee listing on the page, it shows ""Fees 0BTC"".So maybe I am just looking at it all wrong, and the 0.09511953 is just some fractional transaction still sitting in my wallet, and it all good.

"February 11, 2015 at 12:57AM",Jdamb,"Choke on it......""Chokepoint"" shows their hand.","is it just me, or does it seem like the government is actually trying to get all these groups forced into using an alternative currency like bitcoin????If you were all powerful and wanted to get bitcoin a foothold in the grey and black markets this ""operation chokepoint"" would be the perfect way to suffocate businesses in grey and black markets to adopt a plan B or die.I'm suspicious, I've jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire many times in my life and this reeks of it.The way the government handles bitcoin seems above the table to be semi hostile, but actually under the table I think they want people to adopt it.They can't get above board people to fully adopt it yet, due the morality and ethical standard of the middle class, but they know they can get the drug dealers and grey market dealers to take it due to moral flexibility.They take away access to banks on purpose, and force them to the only logical solution. Bitcoin.You think the government want's to pay the national debit??Hell no, they can dump the dollar, dump all their debit, and blame it on the libertarians by letting bitcoin take hold.The most patriotic bunch, and the hard working, employer class will get the blame, the government will say "" we had no choice but to dump the dollar, we wanted to pay China but we couldn't, (or we did with massively devalued currency)so doesn't the dollar failing actually save the Government, and can't they start fresh with no debit, use honest money, force everyone else to use honest money, and stay on top due to past investments into military??we basically borrow money, buy an army, then close the banks so no one else can borrow money. We end up being the only ones with F-22s and aircraft carriers so we stay top dog, have no debit, and force the rest of the world to use honest money, so they can never afford a war let along a war against us with all the cool gadgets.The government side steps the blame, and reaps all the benefits.Essentially we BK morally and financially but stay on top.To do this they need bitcoin, and for bitcoin to grab hold they need the ""grey"" markets to adopt first and blend into the ""white"" markets.They are playing chess, so many of us are playing checkers.And lets not forget they end up with a transparent, easily taxable currency and no debit.Bitcoin may be anonymous but it makes any large black or grey market easy to spot and deal with. They may not be able to tax every transaction but think of the power of at least being able to see every transaction. Ever play a video game where you got to build a little city but there is a ""fog of war"" so you can't see the whole map, then eventually you get the ability to see the whole picture..........and it's a game changer.This is what governments get if they get a currency like bitcoin to take over. They get to see the whole economy, every transaction. Even if they can't tax the black market think of the advantage of just being able to see it, judge it's size, and watch the money flow.Also, by forcing the rest of the world to use honest currency it ends anyone's ability to make war, let alone against us. It also makes tracking terrorists amazingly easy. Just donate one satoshi to a terrorist and watch it flow through the block chain. You can see how they take it in, how they wash it, and how they spend it.Terrorists are amazingly stupid if they use bitcoin. I have money in bitcoin as an investment and I think it will take over, but I think maybe we are jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire once again.I think any red blooded american should own some bitcoin because it seems to be that it's in the best interest of the United states to dump the dollar, pay off it's debit with massively devalued money, and force everyone to ""play honest"" from now on.At some point BK becomes the only viable option, and when you have the perfect scape goat its just so simple and easy. It's the fastest way to get from A to B.You blame the Patriots, You make the patriots support and spread bitcoin, then you blame bitcoin for the crash, then the ""patriots"" are less likley to overthrow the government during the chaos because they feel so bad for supporting the one thing that brought the government to it's knees. These same patriots will vote in reforms to promise to keep the US honest from here forward, and it's checkmate on the world.The very Patriots who have the most ethical high ground will be the foot solders of the most dishonest, and biggest financial transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.Even if you know this, the best option is to move forward.It is the fasted way to get from A to B. in the end the world will have honest money........many folks are going to get wiped out, and maybe it won't be bitcoin that ends up as the currency when it comes to an end, but it sure is what will start the fire burning out of control.If you believe we need honest money, and if you believe the United States should try and maintain it's influence on the world, then this is really the best, fastest way to make it happen.It will be a sacrifice ethically and morally, but for the greater good, and for the good of the United States this is a sacrifice I am sure they are willing to undertake.Down with dishonest money...........in with honest money (as long as the power stays where it is)this is what we get.......the same people in charge, but with a level playing field..........current score...........Visitor 1, Home 1,000,000,000no one will ever be able to catch up with us using honest money. We have roads, airports, and aircraft carriers on charged on a credit card that we don't have to pay back.thats my 2 satoshis.(so make sure your in a business that produces a much needed basic service with the ability to adjust prices quickly, and don't loan anyone money)Services business are great, you can adjust the prices daily, get paid in dollars , bitcoin, or whatever comes next, and there will always be someone rich enough to pay for a clean toilet. The dirty jobs are the easiest to sell.Prepare your family for the adjustment, get some of the big three, Gold, Guns, and bitcoin, and get ready.the good news is this will be the fastest transition in the history of the world.

"February 11, 2015 at 02:43AM",throwawhuneo,Overview of 1Mb blockspace issue and solutions,"Maintaining 1Mb blockspace If Bitcoin continues to grow, 1Mb of blockspace is not sufficient to accommodate all transactions and users would have to compete for blockspace using fees. If Bitcoin transaction volume stays the same size or only increases by a factor of three we will not have to increase the block size.Because currency requires a network effect to succeed, we should consider a lack of further growth to be a failure.Bitcoin can have 100Mb equivalent in transaction volume with only 99Mb being on a blockchain, but because Bitcoins value proposition is being trustless, 99% of transactions being trusty and offchain should be considered a failure mode as well.Therefore, keeping the blockspace at 1Mb is a failure in BitcoinHardforking to increase block size gradually Bitcoin has historically grown rapidly. Block size is 20 times what it was 2.5 years ago. Increasing the block size by a certain percent every year leaves one with two considerations:Is it becoming more costly to run a full node that it once was?Is the increase sufficient to allow the worlds transactions to be processed.If you assume Bitcoin transaction volume will grow no faster than the cost of running a full node will shrink, you will not be at risk of losing full nodes.Looking at some of the costs, bandwidths cost drops about 25% every year, processing powers cost drops about 40% every year, Bitcoin block size has grown about 400% for the last two years. The increase in block size being faster than the decrease in full node costs leads to less full nodes. When a full node becomes harder to run you have an increasing economy of scale (mining farms become more profitable as they grow) and less miners auditing blocks (pools have more control). These effects lead to centralization and centralization is a failure mode for Bitcoin.If you have the growth parameters set low enough to prevent centralization, you are at risk of the same failure mode that a permanent 1Mb blockspace has: the majority of transactions being not-trustless because you don't have enough block space.This change is a hardfork and must be done carefully in order to prevent disruption of the multibillion dollar network.Therefore, increasing the block size is risky because you must hardfork and you must assume that running a full node will get cheaper faster than Bitcoin grows.Sidechains In any case, if a single miner gains a significant portion of the hashrate the network has less or no security and is a failure mode. To prevent the miners from controlling too much of the network we should have as many miners as possible validating a pools blocks.If a user can process some fraction of the transactions by running a full node, but cannot process all of the networks transactions, we should give them that option. Giving them that option allows every user that wants to make the network stronger to help. With a single blockchain that is increasing in size, users have the option of auditing blocks or not.Instead of creating 100Mb blocks to have a 100Mb blockspace, we could have many blockchains and give users to dedicate resources to verifying the integrity of a fraction of the blockchains.Right now there are a few thousand full nodes who audit the current 0.3Mb blocks. These same nodes could split the work of validating a 100Mb blockspace.This idea is called sidechains and has a few security assumptions including that the majority of the hashrate isn't malicious. In sidechains, the other blockchains have Bitcoins that cane be redeemed on the mainchain. Similar to the mainchain, the sidechains integrity depends on miners not having a large portion of the hashrate, otherwise they can steal coins from the sidechain.This change doesn't require a hardfork and isn't mandatory. It has little to no risk and many softforks have been executed successfully.Therefore, this is a less dangerous upgrade and it is more scalable for a fast growing transaction volume.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/16NBRUq

That causes uncertainty, which means that the only form of analysis is anecdotal and ad-hoc.Bitcoin does exactly what it is programmed to do, therefore it is much easier to calculate the behavior of its users and the future behavior of the currency. We can look at the benefits and risks that people have, and use that to calculate future behavior. With Central banking in its current form, its complicated to the point that predicting the future is virtually impossible.Im not trying to say that we can predict the future of individual crypto-currencies at the moment. But I do believe that it is very possible ( and wasn’t possible before Bitcoin)Fiat does X as long as Chairman 1 votes yes/no on proposition Y.Bitcoin does X because that's what the code says it will do.People will start to see the value in this eventually, it is just a matter of time.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1AkDAwO

Furthermore, the specific funds of my account were spread to many different accounts, which smells to me like a tumbler / Blockchain Shared Send-esque service were used.Only today did I find out that I am now ~USD450 poorer, through no fault of my own. Shit.Address history <- history of the specific address of the HD wallet I was using.The few facts I have to go on make me suspect one of two possibilities:Someone compromised my phone, reading the wallet files directly (this bypasses the PIN). This does not explain why there are several other addresses involved in the same transaction (totaling ~10 BTC transfer as you can see).Someone out there has discovered a weakness in the cryptography of Mycelium pertaining the generation of HD wallets. Thus, I, along with many others who were using Mycelium, were robbed simultaneously.

A company can be on a positive trend even if the price stagnates or decreases, but that's another story because the companies I've invested in have nothing to do with Bitcoin as far as I know.To be more detailed, I invested in mineral resources, materials, 3D printing, nanotech, solar, biotech, big pharma, emerging markets, robotics.I specifically avoided investing in Google, Facebook, Oil, etc.I'm now on the lookout for two promising companies that are involved in either water, waste management and recycling, food-agriculture technology.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1FxAxkW

In order to have a bit of security, I think I need to do this offline, of course. And then not connect the computer I use to the internet, probably. I can not really afford to have a single use computer, though. So I was thinking, could I use Tails (https://tails.boum.org) to do it? It seems like tails is a live os that leaves no trace on the computer you use. Could I just start it, connect to the internet, download the bitadress thing, then disconnect internet, generate a private key, shutdown Tails, and pouf, problem solved?I know this solution of writing on a piece of paper is not ideal, of course. I don't plan on storing huge amounts of BTC on it. It is a first step to experiment with cold storage, let's say.

"February 12, 2015 at 01:40AM",BitttBurger,Medical Marijuana Industry pouring millions into armored trucks and security vaults. Why aren't they just using Bitcoin?,"CNBC. Story comes on about the medical marijuana industry in Colorado. They're making hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet they can't get banking it says.On the screen flashes a picture of a military dude in heavy gear. ""...and the Securities industry is Booming!"" Pictures of armored trucks, bulky dudes carrying heavy bags, etc.I found it fascinating. Because they can't get banking, they're opting to hire retired veterans to haul their shit around in hundred pound bags and armored trucks. Vaults. Safes. Why? Thats like opting to carry a briefcase of gold to a car dealership instead of use your credit card.I realize these companies currently need US dollars. But there's absolutely nothing stopping them from creating an ecosystem that operates entirely within Bitcoin for back-and-forth transactions. Paying bills and buying materials. Sure, it would be completely new, and someone would need to sell all these different players in the industry on the concept. But so what? It's an obvious win-win situation for everyone. Best of all, it's not illegal.This is exactly how Bitcoin operates. You get the fiat into the Bitcoin system and then you move it back and forth to buy and sell. You don't need a bank. And you don't need Fiat. Of course some vendors won't hop on the Bitcoin train, and for that they can use Fiat. But this is an incredible opportunity to get an industry that can't get banking, into a technology that doesn't require banking.Start accepting payment in the form of bitcoin from customers, and you've got an entirely new consumer base that has just found incentive to acquire Bitcoin. Isn't that what we've all been waiting for? Incentive for consumer adoption? Well.. Merry Christmas. Why isn't anybody knocking this one out of the park?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1AnaWes

We sell games, videos, text services, etc.We currently charge our clients through their phone bill. When a client subscribes to our services, his phone bill is charged and we receive the payment through the client's carrier.This payment method is great because our clients do not have to provide us any information. They just confirm, click and they are done. At the same time, this method is burdensome because carriers keep almost 50% of the money and it is very difficult to turn a profit.We have been observing Bitcoin as an alternative payment and we are very interested in this virtual currency/payment platform but we can't think about an easy way to implement it in our system.Just to make it clear, here is our clients' acquisition process right now. We promote our services using a landing page. The client comes to our landing page through an advertisement banner that he finds online. He inserts his mobile number on the landing page, he receives a text with a PIN, he inserts the pin on the landing page and he is subscribed.How would you envision Bitcoin in this process? The process needs to be super super easy, otherwise clients don't subscribe.I look forward to receiving your feedback and I would like to thank you in advance for your help.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1FzeXfY

We’re now crowdsourcing the most attractive and impactful project in the ecosystem.This crowdfunding campaign will have no fee, but still vest on our milestone based fund release structure, such that developer will have fully aligned incentives to deliver after the crowdfunding ends. We want to leverage our connections and influence for the greater good by helping an early stage project emerge from the shadows. It will be 100% donation driven, with all the money going directly to the team. Koinify will do its customary and expected due diligence on the team and the project, vetting and ensuring they are worthy of the campaign.What do you see as one of the most potentially disruptive areas/projects? Is it crypto infrastructure, is it a dApp, or is it an open sourced protocol? What project do you think will help push the crypto community forward as a whole?Let us know in the comments below by telling us which project or team you’d like to see a crowdfunding campaign for, and why you believe they should be picked for the crowdfunding campaign. The raised BTC goal and time constraints will depend upon the project that is chosen by the community.We will leave this thread open for 48 hours. After 48 hours, we will count the number of comments / votes. Let us know, and we can get this running as soon as possible.Examples: BitMesh, DarkWallet, BitSquare, FactomLinux, etc. Projects that haven’t received VC funding, are open sourced, and that would help our community and ecosystem grow stronger.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1ChTkx5

Implementing all the features has been really fun, very challenging, and had lots of in-development bugs and silly mistakes .... And still, I yet have not lost a single satoshi.How can that be?The answer is simple: I use the testnet and common senseWhenever I am writing Bitcoin software I am aware that I am writing software for managing real value.Not just for myself, but for a everyone who have come to trust me over the years. Everything I do is tested thoroughly on the Bitcoin testnet <-- ever heard of it?Testnet is where you can be careless with your coins. They have no real value. This is where you can try and test things for free!Once you have gotten used to not trust your own code (trust me, I don't trust my self, weird as it sounds) it is very easy not to trust the code written by someone else, let alone trust some random anonymous stranger who claims that he found the best investment / mining / gambling / stock / whatever opportunity of the decade. Just send me some bitcoin....Really... I have seen so many incredibly stupid 'opportunities' in bitcoinland where any sensible man would say 'wait a minute' ... IS THE AVERAGE BITCOINER REALLY THAT STUPID?Reading the forums make be believe just that.What can I say:Whenever trying a new Bitcoin service ask for a testnet version.The only free things in bitcoinland is testnet and common sense. If you have no common sense use testnet",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1Acr9EI

Read the law.,"The taxpayer’s relief act of 1997 includes the following stipulation:Exclusion for certain personal transactions. If nonfunctional currency is disposed of by an individual in any transaction, and such transaction is a personal transaction, no gain shall be recognized for purposes of this subtitle by reason of changes in exchange rates after such currency was acquired by such individual and before such disposition. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the gain which would otherwise be recognized on the transaction exceeds $200.Which means: Currency exchange rate gains below $200 realized on a personal transaction are not taxable.In both the spirit and the letter of the law, bitcoin gains <$200 that arise from personal transactions made by an individual are not taxable events.

And see the Android app itself, of course.NEW FEATURESWe're integrating push tips in app with Coinbase API - like redeeming airline miles for Bitcoin. But the airline miles are the WIFI hotspots you add and verify as you travel. For any points you earn, regardless of monthly competition cycles, starting in March you can redeem them whenever you want at whatever thresholds you want. The more you save, the more you earn, no need to compete if that's not your favorite way to earn tips.Reach a point thresholdRedeem points in one press in appBitcoin goes straight to your Coinbase wallet (connected to your registered email)Repeat for lifeAnd starting now for the competition, I'm removing the requirement to add Twitter for tips. I will simply tip directly to your emails if you'd rather not use Twitter. Anyone on Earth is eligible to win 3BTC, 1BTC or 500,000 bits.For the competitors: beginning with the March giveaway cycle, there will be a LEADERBOARD in app. So now you can actually track your progress better relative to other players.FEBRUARY STATSSince we started with ChangeTip in late January, we've tipped 755,499.99 bits (from tips and rewards to providing helpful comments and bug reports)!Our current February leader, Twitter user morphK3T has added tons of hotspots, earning 1300 points for 52,000 bits in 10 days. If you were to add about 120 hotspots this month with WIFI Metropolis on Android, you'd be in contention for usurping his 3BTC throne for first place, 1 BTC for runner-up or 0.5BTC for third place.You can always earn 500 to 51,500 bits outside of competing on your way to 1000 points at your leisure if you'd rather not compete (probably more, because I tend to overtip).Happy connecting,ReillyClick here for tutorial. iOS with Explorer features are coming eventually I promise!

"February 12, 2015 at 04:21AM",sgornick,What would happen if someone released the GavinCoin patch today?,"I first asked this on BitcoinTalk but wanted to see what /r/bitcoin thinks about it.Would there be much harm to the existing bitcoin ecosystem if someone released the gavincoin patch today? (e.g. takes Bitcoin client such as v0.9.2 and simply changes the max to 20MB (or anything above 1MB), sets block nVersion=4, and maybe uses some other port).I would like to see this as it will help us learn the lesson about post-fork fungibility.Why would anyone mine using this client (or join a pool using it)? Well, because there is demand for gavincoins. Why? Post-fork there will be two chains. All 13.8 million bitcoins pre-fork are spendable on the gavincoin side as well but if the transaction includes any amount of a gavincoin coinbase the transaction will be rejected on the Bitcoin side.Initially many of those holding bitcoins (myself included) will want to buy a tiny bit of gavincoin to have some to be able to taint my bitcoins that will then be spent using the gavincoin client. Even if the value of these tainted coins is a pretty trivial amount I probably will still want to sell them for whatever I can get since spending them doesn't impact my ability to spend those same coins on the Bitcoin side -- as that side knows nothing about the spend transaction on the gavincoin side (for those transactions that include any amount of gavincoin coinbase).Because there is this initial demand for these gavincoins it won't take long for an exchange to pop up that offers BTC/GAV trading. (If you still aren't convinced that a market exists, simply look at the orderbooks with buy orders for all those shitcoins).All then that is needed is a pool to mine using the gavincoin client which attracts at least ~6,650 Th/s (roughly $2.8M worth of the latest ASIC hardware) to cause the gavincoin side to get three blocks per day (the current Bitcoin transaction load is roughly 60MB per day so that daily load could be included in three blocks of 20MB each). Also if this gavincoin client is using a different port someone would need to re-broadcast the bitcoin transactions onto the gavincoin fork (and maybe vice-versa so that all transactions that can confirm on both sides of the fork are broadcast on both sides.)So let's say this gavincoin client comes out today and within a few days the first block on the gavincoin side is mined. There should be no risk to the Bitcoin side of the fork as far as I can see -- at least not initially. Now the gavincoin side ... that wlll have so little hashing capacity so those exchanges accepting gavincoin payments need to consider that a 51% attack against that side of the fork is certainly possible [Edit: after difficulty adjusts down on the gavincoin side a few times].Then watch and see what happens. Maybe both sides co-exist permanently, who knows.[Edit: There is however the risk of a transaction made with the intention of it being a gavincoin transaction but gets misconstructed where it includes only pre-fork Bitcoins. Since that transaction wouldn't have any gavincoin taint it will confirm on both sides. That gives the recipient the gavincoins as well as the bitcoins.]http://ift.tt/1AZ63JM",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1FzLX7G

I live in New York City and today walked into my local branch and spoke with a representative. I explained that i have a website that sells goods and that I wanted to accept Bitcoins for my merchandise which I would convert to dollars through Coinbase and transfer to my Chase account. The rep I spoke with was a super nice guy, probably late 20's and I could immediately tell that he was very familiar with Bitcoins. He told me directly without any ambiguity that if Chase discovers that any of their customers deal with any merchants or exchanges involved with Bitcoins that those accounts are immediately terminated. He said he didn't know why this was the bank policy but that if I work with Coinbase or any other exchange then I should expect my accounts to be immediately terminated without warning or explanation. I suppose I could still accept Bitcoins and then sit on them but that won't pay my rent or printing bills... yet. Any thoughts?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1FzPsel

"February 12, 2015 at 06:53PM",NY2Rome,"I just had a cryptology idea, and I'd like to bounce it off reddit for thoughts","I was just thinking that by now, there must be at least one spy agency using bitcoin to finance agents in the field. There's so much talk about how it's used in blackhat ops, but what about sophisticated international spy rings?Then came the thought that became the subject of this post: using low-value altcoin transactions to hide intelligence signals.Someone who is a professional cryptologist could come up with better, but I came up with this example of simple alphanumeric coding system using dogecoin transactions.Hypothetical agents A and B pre-agree that the code-key will be the second and third numbers of the last transaction of the previous day's transmission. The second number will be the double digit indicator for the following day's code, the third number will be the value key.A>B D1,430 The double digit indicator for tomorrow's codes will be 4, the value key will be 3. Wherever 4 appears the value will be double digit.The next day...A>B D1,080 A>B D1,050 A>B D1,412 A>B D1,412 A>B D1,415 ...an hour later A>B D1,920B, now has the message: 8-5-12-12-15, corresponding to H-E-L-L-O, and he knows that tomorrow 9 will indicate double digit letters and the letter number will lead from the second digit of the transaction value.Obviously, an actual spy agency would be using something more sophisticated than a direct letter to number value system, but I wanted this example to clearly illustrate the concept.The disadvantage of this system would be that once someone cracked the code the entire history of transmissions could be read on the ledger, but this could be mitigated by cycling code systems and using a secondary system that changed payment addresses on a daily basis.The advantage is that no one is looking for it (or maybe now they will be).What do you think?P.S.

Bitcoin's got problems, but it's really amazing that it's the first financial service that no one owns and that simply cannot be shut down.One of the Bitreserve guys once wrote (on a Crowdcube message board post) that Bitcoin was nothing anyone could use, but it was everything we needed to change the current bankster-run financial system (paraphrasing). But maybe a stronger bitcoin means a stronger Bitreserve and vice-versa.Maybe Bitreserve and bitcoin should support each other instead of taking big old steaming dumps on each others' heads. If Bitreserve succeeds, it could make bitcoin a lot stronger, bringing average consumers into bitcoin. And the more bitcoin flourishes, the more people who might find Bitreserve's volatilty protection interesting.So let's all join hands and sing the Battle Hymn of the Cloud Money Revolution:Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of Cloud Money; It is trampling out banks' love of nickel-and-diming me; Bitcoin hath loosed the fateful lightning of its more or less swift BTC; Cloud Money is marching on.Glory!

Cloud Money is marching on.I have seen bitcoin in the watch fires of a hundred reddit threads; They have built bitcoin an altar in their hearts and in their heads; They can see BTC @ gold parity even when they take their meds; Cloud money's day is marching on.Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Cloud money's day is marching on.I have read a fiery blog post writ in burnished rows of text; “As ye know about Netscape's demise, so shall BTC be next”; Let the smart-money bet on Bitreserve, and not some hot crypto mess."" Cloud money is marching on.Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since Cloud money is marching on.Bitcoin has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; Smart VC's and the Winkletwins--no way can they be beat; If only Ross Ulbricht had run Silk Road from somewhere like Mozambique; Cloud money is marching on.Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Cloud Money is marching on.In the beauty of Satoshi's mind was born our beloved BTC, Pretty fast, nearly free, and with real-time transparency: But to understand it you need a fucking PhD; While Cloud Money is marching on.Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While Cloud Money is marching on.Cloud money is coming like the glory of a mass bankster suicide, It's a boon to everyone except those banks too big to die, When transparency reigns supreme, there'll be no way for them to lie, Cloud money is marching on.Glory!

"February 13, 2015 at 12:27AM",freework,My thoughts on the 1MB block size issue (its not a simple black&amp;white issue),"Is there anyone who actually believes the the 1MB block limit should stay forever? I have never seen this argument seriously made by anyone. Yet whenever people try to make post regarding this topic, they seem to formulate their argument so that it counters a non-existant argument.EVERYONE agrees the block limit will have to be raised. Anyone who thinks otherwise has no idea what they are talking about and should be ignored.What we need to be debating is WHEN to increase the block size limit. The two camps seems to be ""increase it as soon as possible"" on one side, and ""increase it at a later time"" on the other side.I'm on the side of increase it later. If the change didn't require a hard fork, I'd support raising it now, simply to shut up all those critics who blab about bitcoin only being able to handle 3 transactions per second. Raising the limit would mean we'd never have to hear people make that retarded argument, which is good for bitcoin.But unfortunately, the change isn't as simple as changing one line of code. Since the change can potentially hard fork the network, extra care needs to be put into how the limit is raised. I kind of feel like if Gavin releases a new official version of the bitcoin code with the block limit raised right now, not everyone would install it and bad things could happen.The absolutely worse thing that can happen in bitcoinland is for the community to split in half. One half mining on fork, the other half mining the other fork. This will objectively kill bitcoin. If it was 80/20 it wouldn't be so bad, but 50/50 could be fatal.On the other hand, it we wait a few more years when the network grows to a point where the 1MB block size is being restrictive in some way, then we should change it. At that point, the likelihood of the 50/50 situation is greatly reduced.By the way, once we actually reach the 1MB limit (in the sense that every single block is exactly 1MB and there is a constant and increasing backlog on unconfirmed transactions), the bitcoin network will still operate and be useful. You all must understand, the 3 or 7 transaction per second is only for confirming transactions. Unconfirmed transactions are not limited by the block size limit. The only people who will be affected by the 1MB block size are people who require all transactions to have at least 1 conformation. This is a fact that rarely gets mentioned. Most bitcoin implementations these days don't wait for confirmations.So in conclusion, I think we should wait a bit before increasing the block size. It WILL need to be increased, just not this instant. I say we wait until the 1MB block size is consistently reached, and then at that time coordinate the hard fork.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1KOhJ42

Stop investing in this crap. Whether it's Ethereum, Storj, Bitnation, Factom, or the new Synereo project, seriously, just stop it. There is the recursive wormhole we're going down. People are building applications on applications that are not yet built. And if you look on skype at their channels, it's a giant cesspool of everyone who has other half-baked projects going. No one built anything on Windows until people were using it. This isn't how software is built. And no one is proposing or charting the way for some new paradigm wherein software is made by fiat declaration. If you want good software to be built, wait until someone with experience solving a problem, or with a need to solve the problem and some deep pockets, propose and lead it or finance it respectively.Let's be honest, if you think that you're the smart one here, investing on the ground floor of something great, you should probably check yourself. Yes, you may know more than the VCs. But you have a lot less to lose than they do. Yes, VCs like to invest in buzzword projects.

"February 13, 2015 at 01:52AM",HeIsMyPossum,[Discussion] I believe that Coinbase will be acquiring ChangeTip in the near future.,"I had this thought immediately upon seeing Coinbase's most recent blog post where they publicly endorsed another company, ChangeTip, which directly competed against them, even if they already used Coinbase's API.I'll try to organize this into sections so that discussion can be a little more focused/organized.The ThoughtCoinbase will acquire ChangeTip and burst into the tipping market. They have been trying to become what I call the ""AOL of Bitcoin"", where they take several pieces of bitcoin services and put them together, as AOL did originally.Why?Coinbase wishes to increase the number of account holders by bringing in another service that will cause people to create accounts with them instead of competitors.Evidence #1: Recent Blog PostAgain, this blog post started this whole thing.Why would Coinbase directly endorse a competitor while simultaneously dropping their own brand? That makes no sense. The only reason they would do so would be to try and consolidate services for increased adoption across the internet. This also makes sense because they are using the Coinbase API, but I think there is a counter point to that. I will expand on it below, but more or less they care about accounts, not transaction fees.Evidence #2: Coinbase's Business PlanI will admit that this is speculation, but I don't think it's very far-fetched. Coinbase makes most of their money off of account holders who buy and sell bitcoin there. That 1% in and out fee is probably where they are netting the most. They also broke into the exchange market, but that's another entire story on its own.Assuming that their goal is to increase the number of accounts, it makes sense to acquire ChangeTip. With the acquisition, more transactions would go through them, and they could also facilitate free transactions provided both parties have their accounts on Coinbase. This is already a feature, and it helps them get to their end goal. Again, they like transaction fees, but I think the core of their business is the account holders.This would be free marketing for them. Basically it's a ""You've been tipped! To claim without fees, use your Coinbase account! Otherwise, there will be an X% fee on your transaction."" It's a way to get people to set up their first account on Coinbase. They have every service a beginner needs, and now it's a common ecosystem to send free tips around.Evidence #3: ChangeTip's Incoming Fee ChangeAgain, starting with a disclaimer, this could be coincidence or even simply matching a competitor. However, ChangeTip is going to have a 1% withdraw fee. This could be because they are already in talks about a possible market acquisition, and want to set up the fees ahead of time. This would save Coinbase some PR things if they were to come in and implement fees. Instead of Coinbase ""increasing"" the fee, they will just keep with the same plans. Not a huge deal, but it should help squelch some complaints if this is already in the pipeline well ahead of time.Deposit fees, however, will be 0. This makes sense as they will want more people using their service.ConclusionI think this makes sense for Coinbase, and there is probably already a plan to do so. This all seems very intertwined, but again, could be coincidence or simply two market forces reacting to each other. That is certainly not out of the question.However, I thought there might be some hard evidence here that could potentially lead to an acquisition. I think it would be beneficial to both parties, and we'll see yet another service under Coinbase's belt.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1yrbmuD

"February 13, 2015 at 01:26AM",junseth,I'm not going to tell you what to do... no yes I will... STOP INVESTING IN CROWD SALES!,"Come on everyone! I'm so sick of the crowdsale culture in this space. Stop investing in this crap. Whether it's Ethereum, Storj, Bitnation, Factom, or the new Synereo project, seriously, just stop it. There is the recursive wormhole we're going down. People are building applications on applications that are not yet built. And if you look on skype at their channels, it's a giant cesspool of everyone who has other half-baked projects going. No one built anything on Windows until people were using it. This isn't how software is built. And no one is proposing or charting the way for some new paradigm wherein software is made by fiat declaration. If you want good software to be built, wait until someone with experience solving a problem, or with a need to solve the problem and some deep pockets, propose and lead it or finance it respectively.Let's be honest, if you think that you're the smart one here, investing on the ground floor of something great, you should probably check yourself. Yes, you may know more than the VCs. But you have a lot less to lose than they do. Yes, VCs like to invest in buzzword projects. But they also have the ability to hire and fire and force companies to pivot. Sure, VCs don't know shit about blockchains, but neither do you. So seriously, stop encouraging this crappy behavior by giving it your money.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1EgDk0x

"February 13, 2015 at 05:04AM",BitttBurger,Why is Vircurex still allowed in operation? They've defrauded people out of million$. Where are the class-action lawsuits?,"Among all the BTC frauds, scams, and failed exchanges out there, Vircurex's situation has remained remarkably unchallenged. By anyone. It kind of blows me away that they've been allowed to fly under the radar without so much as a peep from barely anyone. They're still chugging along collecting probably hundreds of thousands in trading fees, and nobody's making a peep about the fact that they still owe millions of dollars to customers.Over a year ago they suddenly announced potential insolvency and froze millions of dollars in customer funds. And they've barely done jack squat since.Despite promises to release funds over time, they've pretty much peter'd out, even though they began offering promotions, ""giveaways"" and ""rewards"" for active traders. How the fuck are you offering giveaways when you're supposedly insolvent and supposed to be paying people back?A friend of mine still has over $10,000 worth of crypto being held, and has been given no access to it. For over a year. Their last ""partial distribution"" was August 2014, and they haven't even bothered to update the page in nearly 6 months. Email after email to their support team goes unanswered/ignored. Everyone I know who has money locked in there is just shrugging their shoulders.Is there anything that can be done? Its like if you run an exchange in the Bitcoin world, you can do whatever the fuck you want with no consequences. I thought that world was over? How about we have law enforcement knock on Vircurex's doors, seize their assets, and distribute it to the public? Oh wait ... they're not selling drugs.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1Agzes2
"February 13, 2015 at 05:03AM",jesset77,Why do so many Bitcoin haters take the position of apologism for poor PC security?,"One of the huge arguments I constantly hear against Bitcoin is ""somebody smarter than you is always going to be able to hack your PC and steal all of your money"".I feel like the underlying suggestion here circumscribes the usefulness of a PC to that of an ephemeral video game console. That it shouldn't matter if it gets hacked or infected because that's just a sign that you're taking your computer too seriously.And Bitcoin is the first example these people kick back against as ""taking a personal computer too seriously"".But today I was just reading this article about the roadblocks to the success of autonomous vehicles.Roadblock #3 is security, and it opens with:It's one thing for a virus to cause your phone or laptop to crash, but if the same fate befalls a driverless car, the consequences will be much more dramatic.Sound familiar..?So it is my position that there is not a thing wrong with Bitcoin requiring a solid and secure computing platform out of it's users. It's only the first of what will be an army of networked-computing applications over the coming decades that utterly demand a stable and a secure environment or else lives and property will be inevitably endangered.So the problem is not ""taking the PC platform too seriously"", the only problem is not taking it seriously enough and respecting your computing environment less than you respect your home and habitat (your physical environment) or your body (your biological environment).",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/17oYbVG

We will be covering how you can use thorough fundamental and macro-economic research to setup various trades in the system and model said trades using our Ultracoin modeling tool. A little about the UltraCoin wallet: It is a peer to peer system, it allows for its users to trade exposure to not only bitcoin, litecoin, Ripple and all of the major (and minor) forex pairs, but over 45,000 tickers of all of the major asset classes - stocks, bonds, indices, ETFs commodities and currencies. Since the trades are peer to peer, Veritaseum and the UltraCoin system doesn’t hold any of your assets, hence you are not exposed to our balance sheet, credit, default or counterparty risks (the blockchain is your effective counterparty). I believe we are the only trading or exchange system that can make such a claim. You can always track your bitcoin through the blockchain at any time. We also offer pricing leverage, of up to 10,000x! We are still in beta, though, and although we are confident the system is working, beta does mean beta. Caveat Emptor! Before we get started setting up trades, I would first like for you to: Read through the tutorial (which may not have all of the latest features described, but we will get to those in this article) - View the sample trade video - http://ift.tt/1z3EIlK Download the trade modeling spreadsheet -http://ift.tt/1B3Y1PM A quick example of a simple trade setup: Currency SWAP A portfolio manager is having exposure to different currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, YEN and CNY. The portfolio manager wants to hedge currency fluctuation. Base currency of portfolio is EUR SWAP CONTRACT DETAILS RECEIVE: EUR=X PAY:USD=XNow, to up the ante in terms of risk vs reward, you can add leverage to the pie. This is accomplished by going into the advanced tab and raising the leverage amount from ""0"". The higher the leverage, the more volatility in the returns, and the higher the probability you will exhaust your principal+collateral. For that reason, you should cushion against having your contract unwound (our version of getting ""stopped out"") by adding to your collateral amount, which is evident in the same ""Advanced"" dialog as the leverage controls. You also have the option of adjusting granular start, stop and cancel times for the contract. By modeling this trade with our trade design spreadsheet you can visually and numerically see the effects of adjusting leverage in each direction as well as increasing and decreasing collateral, principal and the length of the contract. There's a lot of information in the 2nd and 3rd tabs of the sheet. Please take advantage of it.Hedge the future cash flows or the asset prices by creating currency SWAP contracts for foreign currencies against home currency.

If they don't comply with the proposed changes, they can be left mining on a chain that isn't supported by the majority of the economy!Lets be realistic. If all these companies announced they were supporting a certain fork tomorrow, you would already be trying to mine it yesterday.I realize most people here are anti government, but I can't see why I would replace the power I've given to a group of my elected peers, with an elite group of american venture capitalists, which may not have my best interest in mind.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1zziw02

My idea isnt exactly like this, but how would I split checkout transactions to be sent to multiple deposit addresses automatically? Does bit pay offer something like this? Ideally I would like it to be implemented into the website directly without a third party like bitpay.

Because of that, you won't switch to another provider until your amount has been spent.I guess current mobile provider won't like this idea because they love to charge people with roaming rates but if some providers take the leap, the others will have to follow (if people use it, of course).Tell me what you think about it, I'm eager to know your opinion.But, personally, I think it could be one killer application of Bitcoin.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/172PCPb

"February 13, 2015 at 09:41PM",Rassah,Mycelium and Google Play: Recap of what happened,"On Tuesday, February 2015, we received a note from Google in regards to our app, stating:This is a notification that your application, Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet, with package ID com.mycelium.wallet, has been removed from the Google Play Store.REASON FOR SUSPENSION: Violation of the paid and free provision of the Content Policy and section 3.5 of the Developer Distribution Agreement. Please refer to the Third Party Payments help center article for more information.That particular section states:3.5 You may also choose to distribute Products for free. If the Product is free, you will not be charged a Transaction Fee. You may not start charging a user for a Product that was initially free unless the charge correlates with an alternative version of the Product. The Payment Processor must process all fees a Developer receives for any version of a Product distributed via the Store.Since that text is a bit vague, we were not sure exactly what it applied to in our wallet, and were guessing it was one of three things:LocalTrader feesAddition of the option to choose your bitcoin transaction fee that Google may have thought we chargeDonation buttonWe requested for a more detailed explanation, and were told we would hear back within 72 hours.On Thursday, February 12, 2015 we received a follow-up that stated the following:We appreciate the opportunity to review your appeal.Donations may only be collected within an app under specific conditions. The donation must be facilitated via a web browser, and any collection made through a secure payment system. Donations are only permitted for validated non-profit charitable organizations (for example, a validated 501(c)(3) charitable organization or the local equivalent). After a regular review, your app has been administratively suspended pending verification that you are an eligible and currently certified charitable organization.In order for us to process your appeal, please attach a copy of your organization’s IRS determination letter or other acceptable proof in your reply to this notification. The provided information must indicate your status as a charitable organization.Please be advised we will not be able to reinstate your application without the above documentation.So, the issue turned out to be the donation button, which is the easiest thing to fix (we just remove the button), however, Google's stipulations of making us prove that we are a charity, ""or else"", made us think this would be very difficult to get out of. We replied with an explanation stating thatWe were not aware of the fact that giving users an opportunity to donate to the developers is violating the agreement.1) Bitcoin software is very sensitive to malware. If a software would imitate our brand and upload a backdoored version, users would unwillingly send money to it. This risk is partly mitigated by many links pointing to the existing package name http://ift.tt/1bF4fa9 - if we would create a new app, users would not know that this is not a malicious version. If the application stays blocked, we might see someone taking advantage of the situation and uploading a fake version under a new ID, to trick users into thinking a it was provided by us.2) Leaving users on old versions is a potential security risk for their bitcoins. We do need to provide security updates, like in the case of the SecureRandom bug. The Android Developers described the problem at. We are constantly in touch with the security community and were able to provide patched versions minutes after the disclosure of the 0-day exploit. If there would be a similar incident and we had users stuck on the old version, users on Android would be at risk.This morning, Google replied letting us know that they have accepted our appeal and have reinstated our app. We have removed the donation buttons from all our versions (beta and final), and just as a precaution set the LocalTrader fees to 0% as well. Our wallet app should be back up on Google Play by now, and we are glad to have this episode behind us. If you are a developer too, please keep this donation thing in mind as well.And finally, thank you very much for all the support we have received from our users!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1D3GTuo
"February 13, 2015 at 09:41PM",Reggie-Middleton,Bitcoin 1.0 vs 2.0 – or – A Comparison of the Largest USD/BTC Exchange &amp; UltraCoin: Features &amp; Costs,"I was looking at the offerings of Bitfinex just now, after hearing that Coinbase had the highest volume of any US-based broker just weeks after opening an exchange (we’ll discuss that at a different time, since Coinbase is waiving fees meaning those users are hot money, but likely are part of the largest installed user base). What I found was illuminating, at least for me since I don’t follow the offerings of BTC brokers and exchanges that closely. Bitfinix offers leverage, plain vanilla swaps and TRS (total return swaps - basically fixed/variable rates in major fiat denominations for cryptocurrency (BTC. LTC, DRK) exposure). I said to myself, “Wow, that’s pretty advanced.” Then I looked at the fees page, and saw the swaps were priced at 15%. The first thing that came to mind was the difference, and limitations that come with the business models of first generation bitcoin companies and second generation bitcoin companies.To put this into perspective, Veritaseum's UltraCoin offers user programmable swaps (ie. you can make your own CDS, TRS or plain vanilla, or even a custom swap) with exposures to not just 3 cryptos and 3 or 4 fiat currencies, but all major and most exotic currency pairs (dozens) as well as over 45,000 tickers covering EVERY major asset class (stocks, bonds, forex & commodities as well as cryptos) from exchanges throughout the world****. This is all capable at a sliding scale of 10 to 25 basis points, round trip. That's the equivalent of 5 bp to 12.5 bp per trade - or 1/150th of what Bitfinex charges for a much simpler and more constrained product. In addition, all of this is done without UltraCoin havin any possession of your funds, whatsoever. Veritaseum (the company behind UltraCoin) is a software concern, not a financial entiity, thus you have no exposure to our balance sheet. We cannot MT. Gox you and you essentially have no counterparty, default or credit risk because your counterparty is the blockchain, and you trade peer to peer vs. through a centralized exchange. Pretty big difference, no?I will continue my discussion on pricing and features right after I delineate the distinction between the two.The Difference between Bitcoin 1.0 and Bitcoin 2.0 CompaniesTo begin with, I'd like to make clear that not only is the title misleading, but all references to the same are essentially inaccurate. Bitcoin itself is still in beta stage (0.9x) thus its not accurate to refer to 1st and 2nd generations of bitcoin businesses. If anything, we're all in beta. Now that I've gotten that off of my chest... The first bold generation of bitcoin entrepreneurs (it's amazing that you can refer to companies born 2 and 3 years ago as a previous generation, it just goes to show you how fast this space is moving!) built businesses based upon bitcoin as a legacy commodity. Basically, they bought, sold, transmitted or transferred it as a unit of value. They did this because that's how everything was done for the last several thousand years in the financial services industry. Basically, they had no choice - or so they thought. Then came those who read the Satoshi whitepaper and the bitcoin wiki and saw a very different meaning. My team and I are among those entrepreneurs. We saw that bitcoins were malleable, programmable, tools with which one can use to paint upon the canvas of value. A far cry from the moving of static financial widgets from place to place. Think of moving bitcoins around (bitcoin 1.0 companies) vs programming bitcoins to act on their own according to their contractual owner's wishes (bitcoin 2.0 companies) akin to pushing a model T Ford around town vs. programming your driverless electric Tesla to go by the grocery store to pick up some fresh produce before swinging by the school to pick up your kids on the way home to meet you to take your wife (girlfriend?) out to dinner.A Real World Comparison of Bitcoin Companies: Bitfinex (v1.0) vs Veritaseum (v2.0)Tickers AvailableBitfinex: ~6 or 7 (this is an approximation) - BTC, LTC, DRK, USD & (I'm assuming EUR, CNY and maybe GBP). It is quite possible that I'm underestimating their portfolio here.Veritaseum's UltraCoin: ~45,000+Asset Classes AvailableBitfinex: Crypto and forexVeritaseum's UltraCoin: Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, Forex, Cryptos and many indicesCosts Bitfinex: up to 40bp round trip, 1,500bp for swapsVeritaseum's UltraCoin: up to 25 bp round trip for all products (primarily smart contract swap driven)Leverage available: Bitfinex: Assumed to be up to 50x, traditional margin lendingVeritaseum's UltraCoin: up to 10,000x, with finite digital P/L parameters (no margin calls, no negative account drawdowns)How does Veritaseum do it? We program the bitcoin to act according to a mutual agreement between two or more parties, then send it to the blockchain to act accordingly. These agreements are self executing, unbreakable promises known as ""Smart Contracts"". In this case, they are highly customizable, P2P OTC swaps, but we are working on a multitude of other products, services and solutions as well. We also supply very high level, unconflicted, independent and impartial strategy and research for our customers. Since we don't use our balance sheet and we don't act as a principal, we have no incentive to skewer the research in any particular direction.Smart Contracts as Transaction Vehicles: The Safest Possible Way To Exchange ValueVeritaseum's UltraCoin BTC-based smart contracts are: 1. highly flexible - you design your own derivatives yourself using your own parameters via our simple graphical user interface 2. self-executing 3. autonomous 4. unbreachable: we call them, the unbreakable promise! They are backed, fortified and stored by/on the Bitcoin blockchain itself 5. uber-transparent: simple click the ""trace transaction"" button to find the location and historical travel path of your assets anytime, from anywhere you have an internet connectionTrading Through a Balance Sheet-Based Financial Institution vs. Distributed, Decentralized, P2P Software ConcernIt's a matter of risk. This is not a dig at Bitfinex. After looking at their volume (significant) and their offerings (quite impressive given the newness of this industry) the last thing I would ever want to do is to disparage them. As a matter of fact, I give them kudos! Good job, fellas! What I do want to accomplish is the education through the fact that the Bitcoin protocol has given rise to the genesis of a new type of company, with a new business model that can offer a totally new type of product. As you were able to see from above, Veritaseum's UltraCoin offers a very uniquer product with many if not all of the attributes that potential competitors offer, with a slew of attributes that others can't touch. This is done at 1/150th of the price and at much less risk! When dealing with Veritaseum's UltraCoin, you can never get Gox'd because we never have (nor do we want) possession of your coins or fiat - every, at any time. Because we don't user our balance sheet (we are a software company, not a centralized exchange or broker/dealer) you:are never exposed to us as a counterparty, we make the blockchain your counterpartynever have to worry about our capital reserves or the capitalization/credit of your initial counterparty (all trades are fully funded at the outset, even a heavily levered trade at 10,000x),You never have to worry about negative drawdowns, negative equity or margin callsIf a catastrophic event were to occur, say bi-coastal earthquake takes out our datacenters on the east and west coasts simultaneously while a meteor hits the backup center in the midwest, you will still be able to recover you funds - on your own. Since we do not have possession of your funds you don't have to worry about us absconding with them nor getting blown up with them. Each trade has a catastrophic rollback feature which will put you back into your original funding position n-time units after expiry. Unfortunately, you will not be able to complete your trade, but if two bi-coastal trades hit at the same time as meteor to the mid-west, you may not be studying that EUR short anyway :-)This is just the beginning of what is capable with bitcoin (and this is pure bitcoin, not altcoins, no tokens, no sidechains, just pure, old fashioned [at least as old as it can be considered] bitcoin) and 2.0 business models. Wait until you see the new stuff we'll be rolling out.We are in beta, so please be aware of that and the shortcomings that it entails (although it is also my opinion that most bitcoin companies are in beta because bitcoin itself is in beta, as implied above). I implore you to download, and trade with, our:tutorial (which needs to be updated)spreadsheet based trade model to assist you designing your own custom made swaps before committing capitaland of course, the UltraCoin BTC wallet for Windows - or - Mac & Linux, which doubles as the trading client. The wallets have a ""Demo Mode"" which allows you to trade on testnet if, after using the spreadsheet modeler, you are still not comfortable committing live coins. You can get the demo (testnet) coins here.There's also a lot of BTC industry research available for download as well as our blog which has some of the best fundamental and macro research available on the web.

"February 13, 2015 at 09:41PM",Rassah,Mycelium and Google Play: Recap of what happened,"On Tuesday, February 2015, we received a note from Google in regards to our app, stating:This is a notification that your application, Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet, with package ID com.mycelium.wallet, has been removed from the Google Play Store.REASON FOR SUSPENSION: Violation of the paid and free provision of the Content Policy and section 3.5 of the Developer Distribution Agreement. Please refer to the Third Party Payments help center article for more information.That particular section states:3.5 You may also choose to distribute Products for free. If the Product is free, you will not be charged a Transaction Fee. You may not start charging a user for a Product that was initially free unless the charge correlates with an alternative version of the Product. The Payment Processor must process all fees a Developer receives for any version of a Product distributed via the Store.Since that text is a bit vague, we were not sure exactly what it applied to in our wallet, and were guessing it was one of three things:LocalTrader feesAddition of the option to choose your bitcoin transaction fee that Google may have thought we chargeDonation buttonWe requested for a more detailed explanation, and were told we would hear back within 72 hours.On Thursday, February 12, 2015 we received a follow-up that stated the following:We appreciate the opportunity to review your appeal.Donations may only be collected within an app under specific conditions. The donation must be facilitated via a web browser, and any collection made through a secure payment system. Donations are only permitted for validated non-profit charitable organizations (for example, a validated 501(c)(3) charitable organization or the local equivalent). After a regular review, your app has been administratively suspended pending verification that you are an eligible and currently certified charitable organization.In order for us to process your appeal, please attach a copy of your organization’s IRS determination letter or other acceptable proof in your reply to this notification. The provided information must indicate your status as a charitable organization.Please be advised we will not be able to reinstate your application without the above documentation.So, the issue turned out to be the donation button, which is the easiest thing to fix (we just remove the button), however, Google's stipulations of making us prove that we are a charity, ""or else"", made us think this would be very difficult to get out of. We replied with an explanation stating thatWe were not aware of the fact that giving users an opportunity to donate to the developers is violating the agreement.1) Bitcoin software is very sensitive to malware. If a software would imitate our brand and upload a backdoored version, users would unwillingly send money to it. This risk is partly mitigated by many links pointing to the existing package name http://ift.tt/1bF4fa9 - if we would create a new app, users would not know that this is not a malicious version. If the application stays blocked, we might see someone taking advantage of the situation and uploading a fake version under a new ID, to trick users into thinking a it was provided by us.2) Leaving users on old versions is a potential security risk for their bitcoins. We do need to provide security updates, like in the case of the SecureRandom bug. The Android Developers described the problem at. We are constantly in touch with the security community and were able to provide patched versions minutes after the disclosure of the 0-day exploit. If there would be a similar incident and we had users stuck on the old version, users on Android would be at risk.This morning, Google replied letting us know that they have accepted our appeal and have reinstated our app. We have removed the donation buttons from all our versions (beta and final), and just as a precaution set the LocalTrader fees to 0% as well. Our wallet app should be back up on Google Play by now, and we are glad to have this episode behind us. If you are a developer too, please keep this donation thing in mind as well.And finally, thank you very much for all the support we have received from our users!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1D3GTuo

I expected to get up this morning to see the 45btc in my wallet but instead I get this message on their site.""Status: BTC -9.90610000 Dear User, we are suspending your account, as our FRAUD protection team decided to investigate the issue in more detailed manner, and we do not want you to play any further for now. We will keep you updated regarding the status of investigation.""Then when I ask about it in their chatbox they ban me from there, NOW they have totally banned me from the website.VIA EMAIL to support@fortunejackME: ""So not only have you not transferred out my 45 btc in winnings, you have confiscated the extra 5 btc I deposited last night to be able to play while my withdraw was pending, but the extra 4btc I won while playing bringing my balance to 9btc. Will you please provide some explanation and let me know what I need to do on my end and when my winnings will be released?""THEM: "" You got all explanations, we think it is more then enough for now. We are still investigating it USER, you will be notified upon status as soon as we finish investigating the issue.Regards,Andreas, FortuneJack Team""Then the following: ME: Now I have currently been banned from the chatbox. I do not see how ANY FRAUD could have taken place. You can clearly see EVERY hand that was played and you claim to have provably fair gaming so it should be very easy to verify. It is your software, I don't know the first thing about hacking, and you can look at exactly what I have won or lost on each and every hand.This is absolutely ridiculous and I would like any and all copies of hands played and whatever internal records you are allowed to provide. I will be opening this issue on bitcointalk as well as a few other sites. I do hope you work through this speedily but accurately.THEM: Dear USER,We are investigating the issue as we noted, there are some coins we doubt are won unfair, and was fraud. If there is no fraud, but bug found you are entitled to 9.1625 BTC, which will be transferred to your account straight away, in case of fraud, your account will be fully suspended. In any case, we have to wait for the investigation to finish, please allow up to 2 business days.Regards,Andreas, FortuneJack TeamAnd my latest reply: I committed no fraud and if there is/was a bug in your software that allowed me to win, I should not be penalized. I understand the need to investigate large winnings but they were won fair and square. I lost some, then won some and so on and so on. You claim to have provably fair gaming and I'm sure can see EVERY hand history and see that it was played fair.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1uPpH92

This is an inescapable truth. Somehow we all know this but we are pretending it does not matter.If this were the fiat world, it's like saying, 15 months ago a loaf of bread was $1, and now it costs $5. Another way to put it, is that 15 months ago, if you wage was the equivalent of $10/h (in btc), then now your wage is $2/h (in btc). If you put savings into bitcoin in the last 15 months, then on average that savings has dwindled. If you have invested in bitcoin in the last 15 months, then on average you have made a bad investment.Somehow, even with deflationary currency, we are seeing a devaluation that is only seen in the inflationary fiat world when a currency is on it's way to becoming worthless.If any other money supply devalued like this, people would be calling bloody murder in the streets, getting ready to hang the bankers. Well, who are the bankers in bitcoin?But how does one go about QE with bitcoin, when you can't just arbitrarily print more, and we have no real system of investments (borrowing, lending, reserves, interest rate related commodities, bonds, etc)?The closest we could come to it would be that for those who accept bitcoin, a flat % costs savings would have to be passed on to the customer, and that savings % would have to be paid back to the seller through some other authority, perhaps a decentralized bitcoin futures scheme that actually held massive reserves. This type of ""decentralized yet central"" authority is bordering on the concept of a standard financial corporation where shareholders vote - but it's the best thing I can think of.Now, what possible incentive would anyone have to set such a scheme up? None, unfortunately, as crypto is not too big to fail. With QE, the incentive is to keep the economy afloat, stave off uncontrolled inflation / deflation, and generally to keep a country running. With bitcoin, there is no real detriment to it's failure - we can simply all switch back to using FIAT, and keep on running whatever business we are running without losing anything of value in the long run.Knowing that bitcoin can fail, and that with its failure nothing major will change in the world, means that we choose not to take it seriously enough to intervene in its design parameters. ""All hail satoshi's wisdom"" leaves the decentralized mass paralyzed - unable to even fathom a central authority that can make changes other than releasing the latest version of wallet software few even use.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1A4CYtn

I noticed there has been some updates so I decided to download the new client and get my blockchain up to date.Now, I was already aware of the amount of system resources used by this client - it is enough that I can't browse reddit without system lag - but the additional inefficiency of downloading the blockchain is absolutely absurd. I have allowed my computer to sit overnight for over a week now (Ethernet, not WiFi) and have yet to sync with the network. On top of that, when attempting to close the client so that I can actually use my computer to do something other than stare at the wallet, the ""do no turn off computer..."" message lasts for several minutes.I understand the blockchain is a large file, but this utterly inefficient client is not acceptable - both in terms of download speed and use of system resources.Is there any way to fix this? I want to support the network, but as it stands it is completely ridiculous for me to even attempt to do so.

I have allowed my computer to sit overnight for over a week now (Ethernet, not WiFi) and have yet to sync with the network. On top of that, when attempting to close the client so that I can actually use my computer to do something other than stare at the wallet, the ""do no turn off computer..."" message lasts for several minutes.I understand the blockchain is a large file, but this utterly inefficient client is not acceptable - both in terms of download speed and use of system resources.Is there any way to fix this? I want to support the network, but as it stands it is completely ridiculous for me to even attempt to do so.

All of the IT-department could be working on the next generation of Artificial Intelligent Agents who can combat cancer. Just to name one type of talent that can be set free to create real value.Those people working at banks should feel bad about themselves, for not doing anything useful with their lives. They are just going to their daily bank job for a salary and that's it.I'd never want to become such a person.In the last 3 decades, the most growing sector out there is the Financial sector. They've grown solely by sucking money out of all the other industries, industries who've employed people that actually created value for society. These industries gained growth by themselves and should be keeping the fruits from that, both the people who work their and the company itself.If each individual in society would act responsibly, everyone at a bank would give up their job and all of society adopts systems like Bitcoin. But people will always be too dumb, sort-sighted or selfish to lay down all the pieces and understand the puzzle. All they care about is doing their little daily tasks in return for a salary at the end of the month.Bitcoin will give industries the power to turn their back on banks by replacing banks.

You could even have it charge you fractions of a cent per page read or question answered so that there is a guarantee of cash flow for the university.Which would feel better for me as a consumer because I'm getting exactly what I payed for and same goes for the company. As apposed to regular education where you pay 1000$[MOOCS are way cheaper or free] for something you might drop out of.It seems like it might be a much better way to generate revenue for MOOCs because they have such a high drop out rate with some courses only having 3.5% completion rate which means: they only get 3.5% of people actually paying for the completion certificate at the end. I'm sure if they used this revenue structure they could, in theory, double the profit whilst still being very fair to the students.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1FaLr2N

"February 15, 2015 at 01:48AM",bruce_fenton,Looks like over 80% of Bitcoin Foundation members are not allowed to vote in the current election - including several candidates &amp; current board members.,"Less than 20% of Bitcoin Foundation members will be eligible to vote due to a new requirement that members ""activate"" their accounts. Even if they are candidates, current board members, regularly participate in the foundation message boards or are actively involved with the foundation. Even those who just joined within the last month would not be able to vote unless they performed the additional step of ""activating"" accounts.Even less than this 20% will actually vote. Even several candidates are not eligible to vote because, like many people, we were not aware of this new requirement. I did certify my candidacy and also sent a written form to the Foundation and made sure I appeared on the roster of life members and that my forum registration was active. No one publicly knows who the actual tiny number of 364 people who are eligible to vote are.The requirement to activate accounts was not announced on the Bitcoin Foundation home page (nor was the election itself!) or on Reddit or on Bitcoin Talk, two of the most popular industry news sources. As far as I can see, no press release was issued. It was only announced on the proprietary Bitcoin Foundation message board which typically has roughly a dozen active members and a few posts a day and by email which is easily missed or filtered as spam and on GitHub which had 4 or so comments. I don't think the announcement of this was done in a fair manner and therefor the election results will not reflect what actual members wishes.I have no idea what the odds of any candidate are. I can be certain that many longstanding members who have told me they would vote for me are not going to be allowed to cast a vote and I'm sure it's the same for other candidates.If by some chance I am elected by the small number of unknown people who are allowed to vote then I pledge to work to improve transparency and ensure a more fair system in the future.The problem is not the rule or the procedure but the poor communication around it.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1zDiPHo
"February 15, 2015 at 02:08AM",Taidiji,Realistic but simplistic model for the market cap of bitcoin compared to gold,"Calculated this in 5 min after seeing the topic on roger ver and 234 billions market capThis is a very simplistic assumption but useful to have an idea of what kind of numbers we are talking aboutin 2013, around 2900 tons of gold were mined. At an average of 40 000 usd per kg of gold (I didn't calculate the average for 2013 but I used today's value of gold, knowing that the average for 2013 was higher than that), the total value of the gold mined in 2013 would be around 120 billions of dollars.Considering that Bitcoin has the potential to be superior to gold in almost every way to store value (and move it in the case of bitcoin), let's imagine Bitcoins takes over 1 to 10% of the total gold market.That means that you could support a bitcoin production of 1.2 to 12 billions of dollars a year. 3,2 to 32 millions $ per day. That's 888$ to 8888$ per bitcoin at 3600 bitcoins mined a day. You can double that price after the next halving and so on.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1A7TngX

So this is what I've decided to do...I've been watching the Blockchain revolution for a few years now(watching Antonopoulos, Voorhees, and other's lectures) but haven't bought any BTC yet. But now thats going to change, I got some medical news a little after xmas. I'm going to be buying some coins after I sell a few things that still have value. These coins are going to my kids. I want them to get these coins when they are older(one is 3y and my second was born in Dec) so they have a long time before they can get access to them to start their lives.Here's what I want to do... I want to setup ""if-then"" parameters with some wallets that i'm going to fund for my kids to incentivize them to learn and grow as much as they can. For instance:Some BTC incentive to get good grades(i don't know if grades will be important in the future though), or complete courses. I may need 3rd party for that.Certainly I would like to set some BTC deposits up in time intervals as they grow.Set asaide a couple for higher edu. This one I'd really like to give them incentives but am worried about the ""if-then"" parameter locking them out if edu is somehow different in the future.Even though I wish to lock up these coins, I really want to make sure that my wife can get access in emergencies.My question is, how do I program coins to work in this manner. I hear a lot about how blockchain can achieve all this and more, but not how to actually DO it in BTC. Is is an ""app"" function yet to be developed?I'm not rich, far form it, but even the few coins i'm going to get could be really useful to my family in the future. I know there is risk in the assessment but given the circumstances this course is the best bet I can come up with. Its not like i'm going to believe in gov bonds. Also there is this huge inheritance tax >:(Your guys help is so really appreciated.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1Fb8wCl
"February 15, 2015 at 03:03AM",kiwikku,Bitcoin's real value is not as a currency- it's as a tool for distributed voting and decision making.,"I think a lot of people are missing the big picture.Bitcoin as a currency doesn't seem to have a bright future in my view. But when I look at things like this: http://ift.tt/19inYzr this: http://ift.tt/1Ct5S7x reminds me that we all can dream much bigger. I'd like to see a future where everyone receives a special voting tablet/smartphone that they can use to vote with cryptocurrency. It (the hardware) would be locked so no new software or apps could be added, and it would not be able to browse more than a select few informational sites online. This is to prevent malware. With an external card reader such as square, anyone could use their smartcard or smartband to sign in and vote like in estonia. Afterwards, all we'd need is that ""killer app"" which makes voting with bitcoin easy for everyone. No more copying and pasting long strings of numbers! Maybe a drag and drop function could be useful here.A ""cityvolunteer"" application might allow citizens to crowdfund local projects and find volunteers willing to do jobs to keep their town beautiful- lessening the reliance on local government.One interesting and positive consequence of voting with currency is that you can vote for someone with as many of your coins as you want- For example, if there are 7 races in your town and you are given 7 coins, you can give all 7 to one candidate, or spread them out equally- it's up to you.

He understands the technology and it somewhat of a believer; but he said that his main concern is with security of it. I agreed and showed him what a trezor does and he thinks it's a really secure simple thing. But brought up that if bitcoin becomes mass adopted then even the most secure systems are just as vulnerable to the normal types of robberies that happen in fiat. Like if everyone has bitcoin then a criminal will assume you hold some kind of wallet and force you to give it up by violence. I think this is a very good point. I countered with multi-sig naturally but no one really uses it. Is multi-sig essential for mass adoption?

The bane of bitcoin newcomers everywhere. You start off with the familiar face of Google and quickly search your way into a hurricane of exchanges and questionable websites all claiming to be the best way for you to buy bitcoin. Today we will take a look at prepaidbitco.in and what they offer to bitcoin users. Prepaidbitco.in claim to be an easy, and fast way to buy bitcoin gift cards either physical mailed or virtual emailed without asking for verification and allowing you to pay through paypal. Once received you can redeem them for their value minus a $3 fee in bitcoins as well as an inflated exchange rate listed on their website. The bitcoins can then be sent to any bitcoin wallet you like, or even directly to a merchant waiting for their crypto checkout. The fees at first seem straight forward. They make their cut by charging $3 from the value of a card when you activate it, having an inflated exchange rate, as well as charging over $4.5 extra at the paypal checkout or $5 for shipping if you opt for physical gift cards.. Bitcoin buyers are no stranger to fees and most will gladly pay more to not have to deal with verification and long waits associated with other websites such as circle (a week later and I have still not been accepted or denied for verification from them). Does the experience live up to the promise? Far from it. I was able to use paypal to pay for the gift cards, even using a prepaid visa through paypal with success. The next day I got an email expecting my bitcoin gift cards. Instead I was greeted with a request to provide contact information so they can verify my purchase. Okay nothing big although mentioning or asking for this information with the purchase would have been nice. They requested a phone number and half a day later gave me a quick phone call simply telling me I should get my virtual gift cards emailed shortly. They arrived in minutes. I ordered one $100 gift card, and one $50 gift card for $160 and received two $50 gift cards. This was no problem as shortly after contacting them about it they cancelled one card out letting me know which one is still good while sending the $100 gift card straight away with a bonus $2 card for the trouble. Finally the moment of truth arrived and I activated the $100 gift card quickly followed by sending it away to my personal wallet. Processing was instant and the bitcoin could have been spent within 15 minutes after sending if needed. Not everything went as smooth as first thought as I took another look at how much bitcoin I had just received. At the time of the redeem the current market price of a bitcoin was about $260 with prepaidbitco.in listing $272.99 as their exchange rate. Using '1/x(v-3)' where x=exchange rate and v=card value dividing one bitcoin by the rate to find how much bitcoin you should get per dollar and subtracting 3 from the card value for their $3 activation fee you can see how much bitcoin they advertise you should get for your giftcard. '1/272.99(100-3)' and I should have recieved 0.35532437 BTC worth around $92 on the market. Instead what I received was 0.28108172 BTC worth under $73 on the market from a $100 gift card. That is about a 20% price difference not mentioned anywhere. http://ift.tt/1BeqTF8 This screenshot shows their response when I pointed out the missing 20% simply saying their exchange rate is not the same as others as if that explains why after calculating the amounts using their exchange rate on their website I was still showing that I was shorted. The card he mentioned was a free $10 gift card that would get about $5.5 market worth of bitcoin after the $3 activation fee instead of the just over $6.5 you should get if they lived up to their advertisement. I let them know they shorted $30 market value from me so they sent the card worth $5.5 market value and tell me the amount I got was correct. I kept trying to explain to them as best as I could with math that I was not getting what I paid for and asked them to correct the problem and send the rest of what I was supposed to get or if they can not help me at all to refund the cards, told them they can keep their free cards since I am not looking to cost them money, and asked where I should send back the portion of the gift cards value that I actually received or as a last resort I would seek a refund through any means I can if they want to short me money and run. They ignored some emails and had a lack of communication when it was mentioned but eventually refunded the $50 gift card, said I can keep the free cards, but refused to refund the $100 and refused to accept the part that was received back sticking me with in the end a bit over $70 in BTC for my $104.67 purchase. That ""free"" $8 of bitcoin doesn't seem so free with that price tag. I am currently disputing the charges on the grounds of not being as advertised and not being the correct quantity. Nobody would accept paying for a $97 amazon gift card that comes factory new with only $92 loaded in it (essentially what happened to me with their gift cards) so why should I accept their gift card that doesn't have the advertised value? I payed $160 for $150 in gift cards that were advertised to come out to about $135.5 after activation fees and their listed exchange rate at the time of activation but only was given about $106 of BTC. If that doesn't sound right to you then avoid prepaidbitco.in like the plague. If you read this far sorry if it was a boring review but when I first came across this website I could not find a decent review to see if this place was legitimate so thought after all the trouble of trying them out I would help out anyone else that is thinking of giving their service a try. I also hope this is in the right place. Have mercy mods as I am new!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1uYl5NX

It isn't easy to represent a wide-ranging community comprising people with very strong and often radical beliefs. In fact, that's a familiar problem for any representative body.We as individuals also have a responsibility to act in a mature and thoughtful manner, considering not only our own needs and interests, but whether those needs and interests, if advanced, would also cut across and benefit a diverse group of people.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1Ab13ij

It's common in chat to imply someone is a moron, or on drugs, or ignorant in some way. It's very much an ego-ridden rat's nest, from my perspective. Jockeying for intellectual superiority is common-place. Only a few chosen are acceptable holders of opinion -- and even still there is conflict and loads of drama. URLs of others' efforts are dropped and constantly mocked. Vitalik Buterin seems to be a fun target. Lot's of proselytizing by people I've honestly never heard of before. Like, maybe you're a big deal in Bitcoin but no one has ever heard of you nor any software you've ever written. It's really gross and tremendously off-putting. It kinda makes me not surprised no seasoned developers seem to show much interest in the project.I've noticed Bram Cohen of BitTorrent fame has been hanging around and people are even really rude to him for trying to work out potentially novel PoW schemes. Maybe he is wrong or whatever but the tone shown to even him is mind-blowing. Basically what's given in reply a lot of the time seems to be stuff like, ""uhhh what are you even talking about??"", ""I guess I don't know enough of your moon math"", or ""I'm not high enough."", etc. But even Bram seems to act like a dick himself fairly often.

I decide to make a small transfer from BTC to BTS, my BTC went through and they it hung.. leaving me super confused. My first time using shapeshift, my first time using BTS so it must be my mistake somewhere, right? I waited hours for either something to go through or someone to come onto chat to help me.Turns out now shapeshift isn't doing any BTS/BitUSD/Nubits transactions now because BTer got hacked. Makes sense since BTer was the main exchanger for those altcoins. Luckily I just sent a small test amount. And I don't even know what shapeshift will do about it.

Whatever it may be, let us do our part to help make it more well-defined in order to establish clearer consensus.As such, what clear set of reasons can we agree on, focus on, and promote in order to most beneficially educate and shape the behavior of supply and demand acting in the market?In my opinion, a clear, simple, and easily repeatable case exists for pricing Bitcoin similarly to gold. Bitcoin is above and beyond gold in many respects, but the bitcoin/gold comparison is an easy anchor point from which to reasonably discuss Bitcoin as a mulltiple trillion dollar market-cap player.Reasoning:Today, I can more easily purchase, store, and transfer Bitcoin than I can gold.While gold's historical role as a store of value is impressive and well-established, Bitcoin is more scarce than gold. Bitcoin is more divisible than gold. Bitcoin is more easy to transport than gold. Bitcoin is more verifiable than gold. And, in terms of its trans-continental transactability, Bitcoin-the-network is more durable than gold-the-network.In 2013, about $320 million of gold was mined per day. Presently, about 3600 bitcoins are mined each day. If Bitcoin was valued equally to gold, each bitcoin would thus be worth about $88,888.Let us agree on Bitcoin's superiority to gold and establish a unified base target price of $88,888 per bitcoin.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/19m0Vnv

If so what did you do?,"A couple days ago I tried to transfer coins from my trezor to my coinbase account unsuccessfully. For those of not familiar, there is a setting on trezor requiring pin authentication when sending transactions. After numerous attempts at inputing the pin and rechecking the instructions multiple times to make sure I was following the Trezor certified instructions - the device kept popping up with ""incorrect pin"" error and denying my request to send my coins. Frustrated, I emailed customer service [support@bitcointrezor.com] where I detailed my troubles and included a picture of me inputing the pin exactly how the instructions directed me to. The feedback was to either input the pin again or wipe and use the recovery seed. I inputted about 5 times after this and had to stop for the sake of the device and my sanity and I resolved to try again in a couple days. After 7 days I plugged myTrezor into the computer and booted up the myTrezor page where upon review my account balance was 0.00btc - a bit unnerved I referred back to the previous support exchange via email and the Trezor FAQs where I was directed to wipe my device and use my recovery seed. All good! I just so happen to have my recovery seed handy. Go through the trouble of inputing my 24 recovery words - Trezor resets and lo and behold! NO BITCOINS. Missing 2.19btc. Okay maybe they DID transfer to my coinbase account. Nope nothing there. Trace the address turns out my btc are in the Trezor address but somehow, I magically have no access to the address because the ""Recovery"" process gives me a different address. Reached out to Trezor and Satoshi Labs for support and no response. Now I am hesitant to use Trezor again to store my coins for lack of functionality and faults in their product and lack of customer support.

A little background for this request, I am currently a sophomore at university pursuing accounting. Ive followed Bitcoin for a while, had a few usb ASIC miners last year but sold to simply recover my expenses. Last year I took an Economics 100 with a really cool professor, it was a fun class and we even had discussions on Bitcoin (this was during the $1000 peak as well). He's always been intrigued by the phenomenon and likes to incorporate as much new and current information as he can into his course.Fast forward to this year, I luckily managed to snag a spot in his Economics 210 course. During the first day, he set a bunch of different types of paper currency on the table at the front and asked what makes it valuable? No one in the class besides me even mentioned bitcoins and the proof of work. But it got me thinking, I should give him a paper wallet to add to the mix.I talked to him about it and he loved the idea. So Im asking anyone on this sub who has a nice printer (I thought there was one that was able go print in nice color and have cool security codes and such like on today's USD)I have 0.05 btc to put on the paper wallet and would be willing to pay for shipping and your time through Paypal or by some more btc (whichever floats your boat, I just need to buy some more then lol)If anyone can help, it would be awesome and much appreciated!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1yMtJdR

"February 17, 2015 at 12:02AM",Reggie-Middleton,Translating Goldman Sachs Top Recommended Trades for 2015 into Bitcoin Derivative Macro Trades,"Cross-posted from http://ift.tt/1FiEmx6 Translating Goldman Sachs ECB QE 2015 trade recommendations into UltraCoin trade setups: Receive exposure to the SPDR Eurostoxx 50 long ETF (speculating that the top 50 EZ equities will rise from currency wars & QE) and pay exposure to the ProShares Ultra Euro ETF (ULE) (with minimum of 2x leverage set in UltraCoin client, up to a practical limit of 50x) seeking to provide twice the exposure to the performance of euro versus the U.S. dollar on a daily basis (speculating the euro will fall relative to the US dollar as a result of currency wars & QE). This trade can be made cleaner by shorting the EURUSD pair directly with a healthy dose of leverage. This would be entered into UltraCoin as ""pay"" EURUSD (with system leverage set at 50x). Since November 28th, this trade would have been unwound by the UltraCoin server with a near 100% (gross of fees) gain using anything over 7x leverage. There are still some legs left on the trade short term, but we are suspicious of the european equity markets being fully able to benefit from this round of QE to the extent anticipated by the media and sell side analysts.According to Forbes:Goldman’s first non-U.S. trade recommendation revolves around an expectation European stock markets rise in 2015 as the impact of ECB money-printing makes its way into the real economy. Goldman recommends investors go long a December 2015 Eurostoxx 50 call spread, buying a Dec. 2015 strike call at 3,150, and selling a Dec. 2015 strike call at 3,450. “The (nearly) at-the-money 3150 call costs 170.6, while selling the 3450 call costs 69.10 (both priced as of the close on November 19), giving this position a maximum potential 2-to-1 payout,” notes Goldman. The firm sees two reasons European stocks will move higher: regional growth simply accelerates, or disappointing inflation readings force the ECB into added action. Both scenarios, Goldman believes, augur well for European asset prices.First, let's put this in a form that can be traded via UltraCoin. To go long the Eurostoxx 50, we'll receive exposure to the SPDR Eurostoxx 50 long ETF (speculating that the top 50 EZ equities will rise from currency wars & QE) and we will pay exposure to the ProShares Ultra Euro ETF (ULE) seeking to provide twice the exposure to the performance of euro versus the U.S. dollar on a daily basis (speculating the euro will fall relative to the US dollar as a result of currency wars & QE). It should also be noted that leveraged ETF products usually seek to match the return of the euro against the dollar over a single day. Due to this and the compounding of daily returns, the returns of the product may deviate from long term return rates, suggesting that investors need to monitor their holdings closely if they are going to be in for a long time period. It should also be noted that this is a materially more advanced trade setup than that recommended by Goldman, for it captures potential euro downside movement relative to the dollar AND potential european equity market upside -which, according to the Goldman hypothesis, are tightly linked. One would think that Goldman should start recommending trading with UltraCoin, no?This is what the trade would have done as of Friday's market close.This trade setup was made before we instituted leverage directly into the system. Now, you can go into the ""Advanced"" tab and turn the leverage up. We recommend leveraging 2x to 50x, contingent upon your risk tolerance and collateral posting (the more collateral posted, the less chance of getting the contract unwound as your trade goes out of the money. You can also use the direct forex pair EURUSD (levered ETFs suffer from decay issues) and turn the leverage up even more in the UltraCoin client, which gives the same exaggerated price movement, but will track the primary underlying asset more closely. The trade pictured above, would have unwound in your favor by now with anything over 6x leverage with a near 100% return on invested capital. Not bad for 2 and a half months.See the full analysis. This trade was initially posted on November 28tth, 2014. It did very well. For those who are not familiar with my previous calls, reference: - 1. Reggie Middleton via Wikipedia - 1.

Many people are saying this will be Greece's exit from the euro, which will cause an immediate crash in world stocks (notice too how world stocks hit total high record today).Alternatively, the EU may not actually give Greece the boot because it would hurt the eurozone too much, so they will let Greece stay without having to pay back debt. This will be a disaster in the short run when soon Italy, Spain, Portugal, and others tell the EU that if Greece doesn't have to pay, than neither will we.If you remember it was Greece's first collapse that shot bitcoin up like a rocket as people around the world learn just how fragile the banking system can be.

I think also big changes to the bitcoin protocol should be considered as that would be the last necessary (not in the real world proven to work) big change for the bitcoin protocol.The title might be a litle extreme but i think sidechains would be a good signal to users of cryptocurrencies that they can rely on the value of bitcoins without fearing that some super cool feature of some other cryptocurrency would make bitcoins worthless.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1zIGHcE

Before ordering all this, we made 3D printed versions of the buttons and cases to make sure everything fits right (you may remember these), but the company making the buttons must not have used enough pressure to make them, and the buttons are a few microns too thick, getting stuck when they are pushed in. Because of that the casing factory failed to put those 800 boards in metal cases. We found out about this early last week, and made the decision that instead of delaying any further, that we'll take care of shaving the buttons and assembling them in the office ourselves, before flashing the firmware. That way we can handle any more situations on our own, instead of having to contact the factories every week and only then finding out that they ran into some problems. The boards, along with 1000 metal cases and 5000 plastic package boxes, have been shipped to our Vienna office last week, and we expect to get them sometime this week. Once assembled, flashed, and packaged, they will all be shipped to Amazon distribution centers in Europe and US, and shipped out from there. For some orders from more distant countries we will be shipping them directly. There are remaining 200 units that got held up in the factory due to some issues with the flash memory circuitry, but we were told they will fix them right after Chinese holidays which end on February 25th. Our total number of orders so far is 911, so only the last 111 units will get delayed a bit, through probably not by much.For now we may hold off on making more units until we see if there is still demand for these. There should still be plenty for people to buy from a few of the resellers we have sold business packs to, and we will continue to sell the remaining 89 units either directly or at bitcoin conferences.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1EhZ2BK

I'm a big fan of bitcoin, but doesn't the possibility of sidechains make this argument fallacious? What I mean is this: an altcoin with better properties than bitcoin is released as a sidechain. Maybe only 1000 BTC worth is moved to this sidechain. But it immediately has a floor support of 1000 BTC because it's a 2-way peg, right? But as its utility spreads, its value (in USD) can climb way above bitcoin's value. Bitcoin itself can even shrink as everything moves to this sidecoin.Granted bitcoin still has the network affect of adoption too, which a sidecoin would have to overcome, but I don't think that would be too difficult. If something is better people will switch, just as people will switch from fiat to bitcoin.Where am I going wrong?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1vQyisT

"February 17, 2015 at 03:24PM",ghostsofsadako,Fairly noob question... change addresses.,"Hi there, so I've been accruing some coin for a while now. Generally I buy coin from Bittylicious and send it to a multibit wallet which I keep offline on various media. Every now and then I load up the wallet to check that everything is ok and that transactions have entered the wallet.My method of storage is that I've copied all the multibit data files and of course wallet.dat to removeable media and have then encrypted that further with Axcrypt. I then removed the original files from the PC and now they exist only on the various removable media (including one in a different physical location).Q1. Is this a decent security system? Any tips much appreciated.Q2. I've only just read about change addresses and now I'm paranoid that one day my backups might be incorrect and will miss transactions due to exceeding the 100 limit. Do I need to make fresh backups of wallet.dat every so often meaning that I would then have to copy over all my various backups including the off site one?Long first post but thanks in advance for any tips!

If they accepted deposits with USD, it would expand their customer base by leaps and bound. Right now, let's face it, there are under a million bitcoin users. It limits their customer base massively. Since every Changetip transaction is done internally, offchain, I don't see how Changetip is a bitcoin company in any way. It displays the tips in bits, which is just horribly confusing to new users who are unfamiliar with bitcoin, limits their user base to bitcoin users, and adds nothing to the company. If they accepted deposits through Paypal and a credit card, their company could operate the same way it is now, except it would be more user friendly without tips being denominated in bits, and it would expand their user base to non bitcoin users.So how is bitcoin helping Changetip in any way shape or form? Bitcoin technology doesn't enable Changetip because everything is offchain - this business could ditch bitcoin altogether and become arguably more successful.Thoughts?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1DBYxE2

The wallet will now monitor your Orbot connection, launch it if it's not running, and will let you know if Tor access is available or not. Previously if Tor access wasn't available, Android OS would quietly switch it over to open web without us being able to control or stop it. We initially included built-in Orchid library, that would have allowed the wallet to have its own built-in Tor without any third party apps, but it proved to be extremely slow (took a minute or longer to connect and synchronize every time). If anyone has trouble getting Orbot due to it being blocked in your country, let us know and we may host an apk of it ourselves as well.Other changes include:Multiple fiat selection - you can now select a few currencies at the same time, and cycle through them in your balance, send, and receive displays (just press on the currency code with a tiny triangle in the bottom-right corner)Creating single key accounts was restored due to popular (aka bos's) demandTransaction confirmations are now shown as pie charts (yellow to green) as opposed to number of confirmations (doesn't confuse newbies)In Transactions tab, you can now add outgoing transaction addresses to the address bookTransactions tab now shows fiat values. However, initially these are just values shown at the current price, not historical prices. We will implement historical prices in the future (that would require our server to keep a running record on multiple exchanges and for multiple currencies)In Transactions tab, added a ""Reload Account"" button if the list is empty, and ""Reload Account"" in the menu that you can run any time in case you think transactions are missingIn Accounts tab, split the list of accounts into subcategories, with ""HD,"" ""Other,"" and ""Archived.""In Accounts tab, there are now subtotals for each account type, and a total for all active accounts.The totals can be shown in Fiat or Bitcoin by pressing on the Total number.Added the option to select miner-fee directly in send-dialogConnection-logs are now available in the about-dialogAdded bitfinex as price-sourceAdded option to export xPub/xPriv key of HD-AccountsNFC icon is shown in the Receive dialog if NFC is availableIf wrong PIN is entered, it now shows a PIN reset hintApp now shows a list of changes after each upgrade[bug] Fix wrong locale for some LT-messages[bug] Google-Geocoder JSON response changed[bug] Fix number entry in send-dialog, [GitHub:146]Now we are on to adding more support for HD accounts such as Cold Storage spending from HD paper wallets and HD watch only addresses, built-in support for Trezor and Ledger, and a slew of other things.

I've been doing the following:mining (at a loss, but it was still a learning experience)using offline wallets with Armorypurchased a TrezorLately I've been interested in multi-sig and have been experimenting with it using Greenaddress and my Trezor.In the default 2of2:Greenaddress has a private keyI have a private keyBoth parties must sign in order to send bitcoin from your multi-sig wallet.The part I am slightly confused about is that my private key is also connected to a regular wallet (address starts with 1). I assume you should only use this private key for signing of transactions for the multi-sig wallet (address starts with a 3), and not store coins in the regular wallet.I assume that you could store coins in this regular wallet but this wallet is completely independent from the multi-sig wallet. I don't know why you would do this unless you were re-using an existing private key to create a new multi-sig wallet.If this is true, then in a 2of3 multi-sig situation:green address private keymy private key #1my private key #2Both my private key #1 and #2 are also regular wallets, and theoretically you could store coins in them.Would there be any reason why you would store coins in these wallets in a multi-sig setup?<edit - better formatting>",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1vDfNm7

CAVIRTEX has been the best exchange I've ever used by far.Extremely reliable for years straight... not exactly what most of us expect from medium size Bitcoin businesses.I will have to try Quadriga and Cointraders. I trust the guys behind Cointraders but they have a tiny volume and very limited withdraw methods. I have no idea who the team behind Quadriga is so as of yet I obviously don't trust them.I still can't believe that I will stop getting my super quick withdrawls to my VIRTEX debit cards (7 days a week!).Very sad day for Canadian Bitcoiners.I have to assume there is more to this story than they are willing/able to let on. They have a very loyal base of users who would keep using them after a data breach... especially one that didn't cost any money!If I had to guess I would say this is somehow related to government involvement and CAVIRTEX would rather shut down than comply with what they gov is insisting they do to their customers.No way a successful, multiple years old company would decide within 48 hours to completely fold because of a partially compromised database.Could it have something to do with their public share offering?

Not to fear, bitcoin is still extremely volatile compared to just about all forex. Below is an info graphic show the components of a long BTC trade with 55x price leverage and hard set P/L parameters (ie. you can only lose or win ~the amount of capital put at risk - no more and no less. At 55x leverage for a 2 day trade, the cost/potential return ratio is maximum given a standard deviation of just over 12.5%. - as performed through an UltraCoin BTC swap.I urge all bitcoin traders to give this a try. Be aware that one leg of the swap is teh EURUSD pair to be paid for the long BTC exposure. The reason is because (at least for longer term transactions/swaps) chances are the euro will depreciate further relative to the dollar.If one were to take a short position in BTC, then I (personally) would pay teh USDJPY pair since it looks like Japan is not interested in having the ECB out-debase its currency. I believe Japan was the reason the ECB engaged in QE at this level in the first place. See my currency war series on the blog, or the several thousand article on BoomBustBlog for more info.![BTC trade](http://ift.tt/1L8t5y6)This is just the beginning of what is capable with bitcoin (and this is pure bitcoin, not altcoins, no tokens, no sidechains, just pure, old fashioned [at least as old as it can be considered] bitcoin) and 2.0 business models.

"February 18, 2015 at 07:57AM",go1111111,Why are merchants choosing not to offer discounts for paying with BTC?,"The standard argument for why merchants should accept BTC is that it will save them money: instead of paying a 3% fee to a credit card company, they instead pay only 1% to Coinbase or BitPay. So that is 2% they are saving on every Bitcoin sale.Additionally, they also bear no chargeback risk with Bitcoin, so by accepting BTC they save whatever % of revenue they lose to chargebacks.So if chargebacks cost a merchant another 2% of revenue, then a merchant should be able to offer a 4% discount for paying in BTC and break even (they save 3% on the ccard fee, save 2% for chargebacks, but pay 1% to Coinbase/BitPay. 3 + 2 - 1 = 4).From my perspective as a consumer, a 3% discount is the absolute minimum discount I'd need to buy things with Bitcoin. If I buy something with my credit card I get 2% cash back. If I buy with BTC, I have to pay 1% to Coinbase to obtain the coins at some point. So I get a benefit of 3% by using credit cards. At a 3% discount for using BTC, I don't care either way which method of payment I use. If the discount is greater than 3%, then I save money paying with BTC.So why aren't merchants offering discounts for buying with BTC? If my estimate for chargeback risk above is correct, they could offer a 3.5% discount and both the customer and merchant would save 0.5%. I have two guesses for why merchants don't do this:Guess #1: The % of revenue that merchants lose to chargebacks is usually very small -- less than 1%. If chargebacks cost 1% of revenue, then merchants only save 3% by using Bitcoin. But we see above that as a consumer I need more than a 3% discount to prefer buying with Bitcoin. So if chargebacks cost less than 1%, the economics don't work.Guess #2: There are some rules that prevent merchants from offering a discount for buying in BTC. Some states have laws against merchants charging more when a credit card is used, although this shouldn't affect merchants in other states. Perhaps Visa/Mastercard have rules that punish stores who give people discounts for not using a credit card.Can anyone more familiar with the payments industry shed some light on why merchants are choosing not to offer BTC discounts?It would be especially interesting to hear from people who own businesses. If you don't offer BTC discounts, can you explain why?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1Jos75a

However, a while ago I released a few scripts to easily run a full node on Debian (Linux). The scripts included an upgrade script (upgrade.sh). If you're using the package I created, be sure you run your upgrade script. It only takes about 30 seconds. (FYI: it'll restart bitcoin-qt deamon, so your peer connections will be reset.)There were some compatibility issues with my scripts from v0.9.3 to v0.10.0, and these have been updated. So be sure you pull the new version of the scripts:cd /path/to/fullnode/scripts git pull origin master It might even be wise to add it to a cron job, if you haven't already. It should be safe to run once a week, or month, etc (as root). If you're new to Linux or Debian, and want to do this, you may execute:sudo crontab -e Then, append: 0 0 1 * * /path/to/upgrade.sh And save/exit. Obviously, replace ""/path/to/upgrade.sh"" to your absolute path to the upgrade script within the package I've made. The ""0 0 1 * *"" tells cron to run this script every first day of the month at midnight.If you aren't running a full node (on Debian) and would like to, here is a link to my scripts: http://ift.tt/1sYgkRm me know if you have any questions or problems, etc.If you use cron to update the node, then I would advice against adding a ""git pull"" to your update cronjob in order to handle future compatibility.

My idea is to only display the first few characters, enough to guarantee that no attacker could create an address with the same first characters and dupe the user to send funds to his address.According to this Vanitygen page, an AMD Radeon 58XX or 68XX GPU can search through 23.5 Mkey/s. Assuming an attacker is really well equipped, and can do 25 Gkey/s for a whole year, then an attacker can search through 25*10^9*60*60*24*365 keys.Since Bitcoin addresses are represented in base58 (disregarding the first character in a Bitcoin address being fixed to 1 or 3), if I show 12 characters after the first character, then the probability of an attacker succeeding is 0.054% according to my calculations.I'm therefore considering only displaying the first 13 characters of Bitcoin addresses in the ""Confirm transaction"" pane.

"February 18, 2015 at 10:39PM",Reggie-Middleton,"What is ""Digital Leverage"", How It Can Be Offered In Amounts Exceeding 1,000:1, and Why Is It Safer Than Brokerage Margin Accounts?","Cross-posted from http://ift.tt/1Ld1w8G was asked how the UltraCoin wallet was able to supply leverage to BTC holders through their wallets and wanted to take the time to give a thorough, complete answer (as compared to the curt answer that was given earlier, my apologies). This is a layman explanation, or at least a verbose explanation. TL;DR, I will take some words to explain this, if you don't have the time to read it, the quick answer is that we use a multiplier - if you do have the time, please read on for that word doesn't truly capture all of what is going on.I was asked how the margin was supplied, and I answered digitally. Many people in the financial industry doubt bitcoin and particularly blockchain related inventions because it differs from the perception of physically based financial entities in that bitcoin is primarily digital (although the currency and the vast amount of assets in physically based vehicles are primarily digital as well). When you go to your bank, and see your savings account with $800k in it, you are not looking at a vault with 800k pieces of paper in it, back by 800k little pieces of gold bullion or US military might units (guns). We all know that if we all went to the bank and asked for those pieces of paper, the bank will say ""no"" or collapse in the process of trying to comply because the (actual asset-back) paper is not there or is there only in fractional amounts. This is known as fractional reserve banking. Anybody who deals primarily in major currencies deals with digital currencies and digital assets, and if you deal with money center banks you are dealing with digital loans, primarily ""digital margin"". How is that, you may ask?Well, when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury decided that the banking system needed more liquidity, they didn't go to the US mint and say, start making more quarters, nickels, dimes and dollars, they booted their computers and pushed a button that multiplied the money supply. They literally used a calculator and pushed the ""X"" button to put more ""digital"" money in the system. Of course that ""new"" ""digital"" ""money"" was backed by no more economic value than the smaller, older amount of money was so they essentially lowered the value of each dollar by adding more dollars (in numeric terms) to the system without a requisite increase in economic value to back said dollars, then took those new dollars (that were worth less per dollar) and sent them to failing banks to bail them out. The rub is, economically the banks weren't truly bailed out, they got more money that was worth less, so essentially were in the same position that they were in before... BUT>>>>> The banks knew that most people and entities prefer to see the numbers and physical representations of value vs. the actual value itself, so they got away with the charade that is the multiplier effect. That's fractional reserve banking and Keynesian economic policy at its finest.We, at Veritaseum do the same thing as the central banks do, add a multiplier to the money to give you a greater level of buying power - save for one big difference, and what I would like to consider a truly saving grave. Our digital money is finite and although it is infinitely multipliable, it is always backed by the same amount of economic value per unit. So, if we multiply your exposure of $10 by a factor of 10(x), you get $100 of buying power. If you lose that money for whatever reason, it is gone, taken by the counterparty that won the trade. We can print you more money by pushing that ""X"" button just like the Fed, but you have to put up more economic value (in terms of BTC, which freely floats against other currencies to measure and gauge the market's perception of its economic value). We don't create the (perception of) value out of thin air, we just create the credit and by virtue of the way the system is constructed, you are forced to back said credit with the requisite value of the proposed trade - UP FRONT. If you lever $10 by 10x you don't have to put $100 up front (you can put any amount you want up front - $10, $15, $100, even $1000) but you will have the trade closed out and unwound for you automatically by the server once you have exhausted your real value backing the digitally ""printed"" money that we supplied to you. Thus, if you put up $10, and levered it 10x, you now have $100 or buying power. If the underlying moves 10% in your favor you get a 100% return on your money. If it moves 30% in your favor, you still only get a 100% return on your money because your gains (and losses) are bounded by the economic value that you put up front. You can't make (or lose) more than you have to wager, you can make or lose it much faster though, by turning up the multiplier effect. So, if the underlying asset moved against you 10%, the server will unwind the trade automatically because your counterparty is no longer protected with real assets in case of default. With UltraCoin, you can NEVER have negative account equity, there can NEVER be a case of FXCM, LTCM or Man Financial.If we let you make more money than economic value that you put up front, well... then we will be acting in the same vein as the central banks and money center banks, to eventually have the same effect, booms, busts, and crashes with counterparties getting crushed by entering into deals where the other side couldn't possible pay. Think Bear Stearns (which I predicted their fall 3 months before the fact where Wall Street and ratings agencies still had buys and investment grade ratings - http://ift.tt/TWXAhB, Lehman (predicted their fall months ahead of time as well http://ift.tt/Srda5e, WaMu (where I did the same), Man Financial, FXCM, etc. I actually know the global financial system rather well, so when I saw the potential of the bitcoin blockchain and a real application that could change the way financial transactions are done, folded up camp in my advisory business and jumped in the bitcoin fray head first - all in!This new, blockchain-based, method of digital margin protects your counterparty from getting inflated dollars in lieu of real actual value despite the fact that you both entered the trade using ""digitally printed money"".I see this as the best of both world, the digital world and the physical world. Now, I could have answered the question simply by saying we use multipliers, but if I did then I'm sure many would get the wrong impression and think that we're doing the same thing that the Fed or the Bank of England or the ECB does. We do, but we don't. I hope that fully answers your question, and if not, you know I'm always here to have at it again.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1FsW2X0

I am munister, aka user id 43220, where you can find here: http://ift.tt/1ERgwVu've been using BTCJam for 5-6 months and invested over 13 BTC to their website. I love their community and I love the idea of helping borrowers in need to get loans. I always felt that Bitcoin peer-to-peer lending is the next step for Bitcoin to take to be regarded seriously as a currency. I've always felt BTCJam to be a leader in this industry and I was happy to be a part of that community.So why am I writing this text? Because they've wronged me in these past 5 days.3 days ago, BTCJam locked me from my account due their ""technical issues"". As a reward, they stated that they would reward me with 0.1 BTC. I naively believed them and asked will I get a notification when they resolve their issues. No response.Less than a day ago, BTCJam stated they will not give me access to my account because they're under the rules of Money Service Business.Then they falsely accuse me of gambling. But how can I be gambling when all I've done is invested in their loans? If investing in their loans is gambling, and gambling is illegal, then by definition, every BTCJam user who invested in BTCJam's loans is gambling.I tried to reply back to their support, but no response.My emails can be seen here: http://ift.tt/1Bmz6Hx still hold out hope that I will get my BTC back because I believe in BTCJam crew to be good people. I do not believe that they would create a website for the specific purpose of scamming their users. I hope this is just a dumb mistake because the alternative view is that they're all thieves, and that is not something I want to consider.But in light of these recent events, I have to warn BTCJam users to withdraw your money from that website as quickly as possible. Also to Bitcoin users, do not invest in their loans. You might not have access to those your invested funds that you've worked hard for. To BTCJam crew, it's not losing my money to you that hurt me. It's the betrayal of trust. You opened your doors to anybody who wants to participate in your site. Then you slammed the door shut when they've invested not only their earned Bitcoins but also invested their emotion into making your site a more popular and better place. This is not how a company should work, and certainly not a company that wants to be bigger that a startup.You've all been warned.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/17TJpXp

"February 19, 2015 at 04:37AM",Genxwire,Bitcoin Escrow and Decentralization... we are doing it wrong.,"Open Bazaar and all that is great, but what we are missing is individual apps that interlink and communicate while protecting privacy.For instance, a universal escrow service that doesn't keep tabs on the actual items being sold or data on the the buyer and seller beyond the rating profiles.A universal buying service like craigslist that only advertises items with a bitcoin price and is pseudo anon, but doesn't actually perform the transaction or offer an escrow service.The buyer would find an advertised item he wanted to purchase on the bitcoin ""craigslist"" that doesn't log IP, Identity, or any of that nonsense.Then the buyer would fund a wallet on the blockchain via the unrelated escrow service (that holds the key to the wallet for the transaction) and the escrow service will release the key when the seller is satisfied.A third service would be a blockchain based psuedo anon encrypted messaging service. This is the profile that would be linked to from psuedoanon ""craigslist"" add, the seller would tell the buyer his profile details on the pseudoanon escrow service, buyer would fund the transaction, item gets delivered, seller gets paid.Basically you can buy and sell anything online safely and securely. The universal rating system would weed out bad actors, and could be used by any marketplace online without the need for direct integration.In other words, copying the function of an ebay or amazon is great, but it must be done in different pieces by different companies.If you want a shopping list of stuff to buy with bitcoin go to site X, chatroom y, or blog z to find merchants who link their escrow profile to a bitcoin company that does nothing but escrow and has no knowledge of what is being bought or sold, but keeps ratings on psuedo anon escrow transactions only.No ""company"" would be able to make money alone, but together it is a trustless network, powered by bitcoin, that is anon, and no party needs to be trusted without ratings, all three companies would make money off micropayments in bitcoin from their service without knowing the details of the complete transaction.Non of the 3 companies would know enough about anything to piece the whole transaction together, mush less any outside party.Banks and fiat are impossible to do this with. Bitcoin makes it possible.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/17rQIEy

NuShares are held by people interested in helping maintain the Nu network and are intended to be a more volatile solution for active traders, compared to the stability of the $1.00 Nubits share or for users who would like to have a voice in the community. NuShareholders can receive network revenues in the form of Peercoin dividends and can also cast votes for actions that positively affect the Nu network. This gives you a real voice in the future of this currency. Similar to NuBits, NuShares can be obtained from several digital currency exchange platforms however alts.trade is unequivocally one of the most viable options to do so. We are committed to the Nushares community and recommend it as an investment. We have consistently been diligent in security, updates and have been transparent from day one on everything. The user interface has been tested with our users and the ui ease of use makes the whole experience top notch. We will achieve longevity by continuing on our current path and will continue to be a big supporter of the Nushares community.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://ift.tt/1AmkQvb
