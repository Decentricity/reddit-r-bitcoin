Ones not so obvious?,"I have one question: Could the volume at exchanges be a false metric because high volume indicates a lot of trading BTC for fiat? A corollary would be that low volume is not necessarily bad thing.I think job openings that come up in searches on the word Bitcoin and/or crypto currency seems like a good one and really reading what the companies want -- if the description indicates the company knows a lot about BTC and also that the company is well funded are reassuring.I thought the Neteller announcement was good -- now to see, if we can, the amount of Bitcoin being deposited. Frankly, I can also see the BTC announcement not amounting to much -- obviously, if Pokerstars opened again to to Americans AND you had to deposit in BTC, that would be huge I think.More ATMs -- I need to find one and watch it for a while.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30go8p/metrics_that_indicate_good_or_bad_things_for_btc/

Seven per page. No art work (saves on ink).Number each wallet.Cut the paper wallets to size.Use the blockchain.info wallet app to scan each private key. Labeling each one with its number as you go.Using blockchain.info's browser wallet (browser app) to create a single custom funding transaction to transfer bitcoin to each paper wallet.Fill each egg with a loosely rolled up paper wallet & add some candy to the center.Being able to fund all the paper wallets with a single transaction fee helps, since each egg is only getting a couple of millibits.Numbering before cutting before scanning makes scanning and labeling each private key much easier.Other wallet apps that can both scan private keys and create custom transactions can also be used.
