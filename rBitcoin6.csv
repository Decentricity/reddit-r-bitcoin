It eaisly lets you have one extra secure place you can place your back-up wallets, but also, it maks giving out paper wallets as gifts much easier. By that I mean, if I give a paper wallet to a family member right now, they will likely lose it or just toss it out... but it might ignite a spark of interest. With a copy of the private key stored away, I can keep copies of all my gifted paper wallets, so that, if those I gave them to lost them, I can simply sweep the contents without having lost the coin for good.Really, how often do people split their paper wallet into three different ones? Its a neat concept, and useful for wills, but it seems like making that button simply print out an exact copy of the private key would be more often used.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/304q9t/the_one_problem_i_have_with_entropy/

It has the biggest market cap and most people working on developing it and it's applications. When I first read an article in summer of 2013 about bitcoin, I didn't understand it and thought it was about as good as WoW gold or something but after seeing it more in the media and getting more interested in why everyone was still talking about it I read a little deeper and now here I am, proud owner of a couple coins.I think back to when my parents( who are lay people) bought their first PC in the 90's. Pretty much the biggest reason they bought it was because of the internet. I even have photographs of my parents using netscape. The internet in essence was the PC's killer app because from then on I kept hearing about how the neighbors were getting hooked up to this ""internet thing"" to play starcraft with each other.So perhaps Bitcoin will be the Internets killer app and be the reason why the other 4.2 billion people connect.Anyways I need to kill my unbalanced enthusiasm now, see you at /r/buttcoin .",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/305jpc/the_more_i_readunderstand_about_bitcoin_the_more/

Instead, open the Windows Command Prompt program and entercd\program files\bitcoin\daemon [return] .. thenbitcoind [return]That starts the program, even though you see no indication of that in the window. You can't close the Command Prompt window or the program stops; but you can minimize it to the tray and it continues to run fine.

Right now, we sadly don't have any plans to add bitcoin anywhere in the near future. I'm personally not too familiar with bitcoin, but I imagine it must be similar in nature to PayPal. As such, I imagine it would be a very convenient alternative to use on our site for certain users. Although we do not have that listed as an option right now, PayPal is the fastest method we have when it comes to payments in general. So, if you're looking for speed, I would suggest possibly trying that out.We are always accepting feedback on how to improve our site in all aspects. As such, if you would like, I can send up your feedback to our technical team that works on improving the site. If you'd like me to do that, just let me know.

To make matters worse, I've then invested my #btc in an altcoin and saw that the price has gone down since the time I bought. I lose only 15% if I cash out now, and probably the hole will go down to 20%-25% if BTC keeps dropping but I am not worried because long-term my investment will pay out.

"March 25, 2015 at 03:25PM",jrm2007,It is not impossible that possible price manipulation is an attempt to not make money but to undermine confidence in stability of BTC.,"There is no way Western Union does not care about Bitcoin. A low price does not prevent BTC from being used for remittances -- only a price that bounces around so much that a remittance handler risks losing money or has to spend a lot to hedge (which also causes them to lose money) really adversely affects a BTC competitor.Low prices however make it relatively cheap to move the price.So I would not be surprised if we have seen or will see price manipulation just to hurt a remittance handler. Of course, there are other businesses who see BTC as a threat and they might well be doing the same thing.Also, the price movements could be happening without some entity deliberately doing this but does it feel that way to you?I think in the long run, the low prices will cause BTC to gravitate to the hands of players who will not sell and this could cause a short squeeze. At the current level, there are several individuals who could own every BTC in existence; for this reason, I would be amazed if BTC dropped to anything much below, say 100. I would not like it, but if I am right and 100 is a solid floor, I don't mind buying now.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/308e0h/it_is_not_impossible_that_possible_price/

Yes, it's secure and awesome. But with capacity of ~3.5 transactions per second it is not ready for prime-time. Basically we have a chicken-egg dilemma. We can wait for world to catch up to us and start using Bitcoin and then scale it. Or we can scale it now and signal rest of the world that Bitcoin is ready for prime-time. Which scenario is more likely to get Bitcoin to mass adoption? Which is more realistic?Answer is - scale now, don't wait for network to get to it's current limits. People care about their money to much to trust system that can get grinded to halt by mere 5 transactions per second. No major financial institution can realistically start of thinking of Bitcoin as a backbone for it's operations.I'm aware of IBLT implementation by Gavin, hardfork increasing block size limit scheduled for June, I'm aware of Lightning Network proposal.

It wasn't a huge amount of money and I had created a unique login/password and kept the credentials offline so I wasn't too concerned. I log in today, over a year later, because I wanted to withdraw the BTC, and all my coin balances are 0.There is a login history which shows all my logins and the fact that I hadn't logged in in over a year and I recognize all logins, so I assumed the account was not compromised. After some clicking around I found a 'Transfers Out' tab and it showed that a few weeks ago that all my balances were transferred to a trade key, b928d5c7a81a40713407d40a8bf1e92ded1a59d1, with no associated username. WTF?I opened a support ticket saying this and was given this response:Thank you for contacting us regarding your missing coins.Due to inactivity of your account, your coins have been moved to a cold storage wallet for better security. If you would like them replaced back into your live wallet, please reply to this ticket and your coins will be restored at any time.Thank you.Why is there NO INDICATION WHATSOEVER that balances are moved to 'cold storage'. It seems like they are just trying to steal coins from infrequently used accounts and hope that people don't notice because there is nothing about this on their site. Why do I have to collect all this evidence, deduce a fuckup on their part, and open a ticket? I replied that I would like them replaced back into my live wallet, and I have now been told that it has been 'escalated' to the technical support team. This is NOT a technical support issue if it is in fact standard procedure to move balances into cold storage. The amount was not so large that they cannot instantly restore the balances anyway from their 'hot' wallets.Has anyone else had a similar experience?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/308kr5/cryptsy_stealing_coins_of_inactive_accounts/

There are good used cars (""cherries"") and defective used cars (""lemons""), normally as a consequence of several not-always-traceable variables, such as the owner's driving style, quality and frequency of maintenance, and accident history. Because many important mechanical parts and other elements are hidden from view and not easily accessible for inspection, the buyer of a car does not know beforehand whether it is a cherry or a lemon. So the buyer's best guess for a given car is that the car is of average quality; accordingly, he/she will be willing to pay for it only the price of a car of known average quality. This means that the owner of a carefully maintained, never-abused, good used car will be unable to get a high enough price to make selling that car worthwhile.Therefore, owners of good cars will not place their cars on the used car market. The withdrawal of good cars reduces the average quality of cars on the market, causing buyers to revise downward their expectations for any given car. This, in turn, motivates the owners of moderately good cars not to sell, and so on. The result is that a market in which there is asymmetric information with respect to quality shows characteristics similar to those described by Gresham's Law: the bad drives out the good.So now only fraudulent exchanges prosper.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30905w/bitcoin_in_china_lemon_effect/

"March 25, 2015 at 11:16PM",TravisPatron,Andreas Antonopolous Is Fantastically Wrong About Bitcoin,"Last week I had the pleasure of hearing Andreas Antonopolous speak at the ""Bitcoin and the Future of Payments” event at MaRS in Toronto. This was the 3rd or 4th time I've seen Andreas speak, and let me make myself clear, he always brings a new perspective to the realm of bitcoin and there is rarely a dull moment when he has an audience. Andreas is a shining star in the bitcoin space and his work is much appreciated by myself and the wider community. Probably my favorite take-away from one of his speeches was the founding of the term 'snail money' in reference to government-issued, physical money at the 2014 Canadian Bitcoin Expo.Despite his prescience, I cannot ignore one aspect of his talks which he seems to skim over, as though jumping the cracks in a shaky argument. In order to see where Andreas is fantastically wrong about bitcoin, you need to almost 'read between the lines' of what he is saying. This niche of obscurity in his argument is what I'd like to shine some light on today.Andreas talks at length about how the financial industry is going through the stages of disruption - ignorance/arrogance/aggression/displacement. He claims that the banking system first ignored bitcoin, then tried to make it a laughing stock, and we are now seeing why bitcoin is the honey badger of money, and that it simply 'takes what it wants'.I couldn't agree more. This is spot on, and the truth of the pattern can be seen when we zoom-out and take a 5 year perspective of bitcoin.However, Andreas has claimed multiple times that the banking system ""will be displaced overnight"". He claims that the banking industry will be hit like a fly on a windshield. This is simply absurd.As much as I would like to move forward with a money system which is all-around more beneficial for everyone, there is simply no way a multi-hundred year old entrenched industry will be disrupted overnight. There is absolutely no way bitcoin will wipe out banking institutions in a very, very short time frame. (although it will still happen much swifter than most are anticipating). Bitcoin will end this multi-hundred year old way of moving money, but it will take time and it will certainly not happen overnight, or within a few weeks, or even a couple years.The reason bitcoin will end the past monopoly of banking is not because people 30+ years old will suddenly switch to using bitcoin in a panicked manner, but will come from the adoption of the younger generation, as they grow up with a digital-first position in money management, very much the same way the very young seem to be wizards with other digital devices.The adoption of bitcoin will not come as a swift ""jumping of the ship"" from the older generation, but because the older generations die off and a younger, more technology-inclined generation takes its place.""A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.""Max PlanckBanks do more than simply move cash. Their functions will still be needed in one manner or another alongside the adoption of digital currencies.Did email wipe out the postal industry overnight? Absolutely not. Email is now complemetary to the postal industry and our physical banks of today will likely absorb a similar downgraded role. However, these institutions will be increasingly less important in directly correlation with the adoption of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.Instead, what we will see is no ""overnight disruption of the banking cartel"", but a massive shift in what we understand banking to be. Banks today are physical, monopolistic, entrenched businesses where we have to actually go to them (either in person or online) to conduct our business. We must go to them in order to get approval for money management. The biggest shift in the paradigm of banking will come when banking is something we do rather that somewhere we go or someone we trust with our money. Banking will be done on an individual accord. People will have more financial autonomy than ever before as bitcoin increasingly becomes a sort of global reserve instrument. This is what I like to call the ""Dawning of the Cyberbank Paradigm"".In this type of environment, money AND our identities will have transcended national jurisdiction. We will no longer be at the whim of our banks or our national political ""leaders"". We will no longer be fiercely loyal to our national ideologies because we will have gained a larger perspective through the flow of our money, our networks, and our ideas. Most accurately, we will have transitioned to a society governed by number.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/309krw/andreas_antonopolous_is_fantastically_wrong_about/

"March 26, 2015 at 04:14AM",BashCo,I've taken on a part-time community support position with ChangeTip,"Quick historyLike many of you, I first heard about bitcoin years ago, but didn't get involved due to difficulty procuring any actual bitcoin. As time went on, bitcoin kept popping onto my radar. The April '13 bubble, the Silk Road bust, the guy who bought $27 worth of bitcoin in '09, only to forget about it until its value appreciated to $886k, the guy who threw away a hard drive containing $7.5 million worth of bitcoin. And of course, people tipping bitcoin across reddit via /u/bitcointip.This seemed like something I needed to know more about, so I subbed to /r/bitcoin to start reading more. That was September '13, right at the onset of the December '13 bubble. It was also at the height of the Edward Snowden story, so bitcoin overlapped well with my interest in privacy and encryption. It didn't take long for me to be consumed by the technology's potential.I began making Moronic Monday threads every week for the past year. Huge thanks to all the askers and answerers! As I've said in the past, the most rewarding thing about answering questions about bitcoin is to see people reach a point where they can start answering questions too.Back then, I had been experimenting with /u/bitcointip and was left wanting more. Enter /u/changetip. I signed up about a year ago and was quite impressed, even though it was still pretty rough around the edges. I made countless feature requests and bug reports to help improve the service, and was invited to help moderate the /r/changetip sub soon after.A couple months later, I applied to help moderate /r/bitcoin. With a good deal of patience and guidance from other mods, I've grown to be rather effective over the past year.Here's a rough breakdown of the 15,000+ mod actions I've made on /r/bitcoin in the past six months:ban userunban userremove postapprove postremove commentapprove comment85255810171530454644Overall I would say that helping to moderate /r/bitcoin has been very rewarding. My goal from the beginning has been to try and raise the level of civil discourse around here, and while success is certainly debatable, I like to think I've made a positive impact. It's been stressful at times, but I've made some good friends and had countless discussions with some really brilliant people which has made it a worthwhile experience.Get to the point already...I was passing through San Francisco back in January and took the opportunity to spend the day with the ChangeTip team. We really clicked and I made several new friends. They struck me as being very knowledgeable, determined, and extremely passionate about driving bitcoin adoption. We talked at length about the difficulties that new users have with getting their first bitcoin, and what changetip can do to help.I was recently approached by ChangeTip with an offer to formalize our relationship. The team has been working very hard since I've known them and have experienced substantial growth. This has resulted in their support channels being a little overwhelmed at times, and they're looking for a few people who are familiar with the service to help write documentation and assist with support issues. This includes consolidating user feedback to help make a better service for their users.Shortly after receiving the offer, I opened a discussion with my fellow mods to determine whether or not they felt my acceptance of the position would be an insurmountable conflict of interest with my mod duties. The mods were supportive of the news and assured me that several mods review logs to watch what other mods are doing, and they will inform me if they feel that I'm acting in a biased manner. I always strive to maintain objectivity, so this point is important for me. In the past, I have asked other mods to moderate threads where I felt that I was too closely involved to make proper judgements, so I believe my ability to remain objective speaks for itself. Therefore, I'm confident that my impartiality will remain largely unaffected by taking on a role with ChangeTip.We finalized our arrangement last week. My highest priority upon accepting this position has been to write this announcement to notify everyone of my new role. That includes putting together a few tipping stats to share with you because we've all been very eager to see how things have been going. Other priorities include getting up to speed with ChangeTip's support backend, familiarizing myself with tipping on other platforms to better assist users, and helping to write documentation about the service's features. Beyond that, I'm hoping we will implement a forum or chatroom at the main changetip site where users from all the different platforms can come together to help each other out and have a good time.StatsSince January 1st 2014, ChangeTip has attracted ~75,000 users who have connected ~120,000 social accounts. These users have sent ~225,000 tips, of which ~73% were collected. The total cumulative USD value of tips sent is ~$250,000 and ~$190,000 was collected, leaving ~$60,000 in tips refunded to the original sender. The average tip amount across all platforms is has fallen to ~$0.91, while the average tip amount on reddit is only ~$0.37... we can do better!My Excel-fu isn't the greatest, but I've managed to cobble together some charts, hopefully without errors. Please keep in mind that I'm not a data analyst.This chart shows the growth in the number of users, social accounts, and tips over the past year.Cumulative User & Tip GrowthThis one shows four different ways of looking at the total tipping volume over the past year. The left axis is for USD and the right axis is for BTC.btc = BTC tipped per day, minus refunded tips, added to the sum of previous daysusd = BTC tipped per day, minus refunded tips, multiplied by the daily average USD price, then added to the sum of previous daysusd + refunds = BTC tipped per day, including refunded tips, multiplied by the daily average USD price, then added to the sum of previous daysCumulative Tip VolumeThis last chart is interesting to me, but I'm not sure what we can glean from it. It shows the USD and BTC amounts tipped per day on a log scale. I interpret it as showing that 1) tip volume decreases when the price of bitcoin decreases, and 2) the divergence of the two lines indicates that the btc amount of tips has continued to grow, the usd amount of those tips has decreased due to the sustained bear market. For example, when 1000 bits were tipped one year ago, they were worth $.55, but today that same tip is only worth $.25... Maybe I can visualize this in Excel with some more time, but it's not a high priority right now.Daily Tip VolumeIn closing...I'm very grateful that the folks at ChangeTip have given me this opportunity, and I'm excited to be a part of such a driving force for bitcoin adoption. The platform has proven to be a simple, low-risk way to introduce people to their first bits, which is why I believe the ChangeTip community will continue to raise awareness for bitcoin across social media. Furthermore, I've been seeing the success of /u/changetip when pitted head to head against PayPal over in /r/millionairemakers and it reinforces my belief that ChangeTip has a good chance at becoming a major player in online remittance.TL;DR: I'm now working for ChangeTip part-time. I will continue to help moderate as usual, but will defer most tip-related mod actions to my fellow mods except for the most obvious cases. The only difference you might notice is that I won't be tipping as much, but I will be working very hard to help provide the most enjoyable user experience possible.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30aqb5/ive_taken_on_a_parttime_community_support/

No addresses, wallets or keys have ever been placed on our web server. All BTC transactions are done from addresses stored in paper wallets from a local machine.

Wasn't the best decision I have ever made, but live and learn. I bought lots of mining equipment (gpus, power supplies, etc..) and mined profitably for about 7-8 months. Then electricity costs began to creep up on the profitability. After shutting down the rigs, I began to sell the equipment on Amazon.com. The majority of the equipment bought and sold during 2014. The amount of money spent on equipment probably could have qualified as opening a small business.I have hundreds of transactions that relate to mining and hundreds of transactions that relate to buying coins through Coinbase. I also have made around 25-50 purchases using Bitcoin over the course of 2014. Needless to say deciphering which is which is a bit daunting.I am not sure how to even begin with handling this for 2014 taxes. I am aware of libratax and Bitcoin.tax services that are offered. Does anyone have advice as to which service would be best?

"March 26, 2015 at 05:13AM",ThePiachu,Poll - /r/Bitcoin flairs,"Hello everyone!We have recently been discussing following up on an old request a lot of you had made - adding flairs to /r/Bitcoin. The reason we haven't done so before is that we didn't want the flairs to clutter up the subreddit (I'm looking at you /r/ripplers ;) ). However, over the recent months we came to realize that there is another need on this subreddit that can be addressed by adding flairs, and that is some form of opt-in identity verification.Just to be clear - we don't want to do full KYC - that's not the point. At the moment we're consider user verification for two cases:Notable Bitcoin businesses identifying their employees - this is to prevent people to be Coinbase_John_Doe and claim to speak for that company. We want the companies to be able to verify their employees (and be responsible for maintaining the list in case someone leaves) to be able to address our subreddit subscribers in more official manners.Notable Bitcoin individuals - the term is a bit more fuzzy, but the same still applies - we want to prevent people from claiming to be, say, Andreas Antonopoulos, and spread misinformation.We haven't figured out the exact details of how we will verify everyone, or who will qualify (there are a lot of Bitcoin businesses and individuals out there, but not all are ""notable""). First, we would like your input on whether or not you want flairs in this subreddit at all:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PcQILGhfSM6u-lmqMEjf4peVoDCI_kvATwv_A63gUdI/viewform?usp=send_formLet us know what you think!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30aygv/poll_rbitcoin_flairs/

I can't solve it in my head, but could these platforms hold the solution. Help?","In short. Here is an example use case of the fundamental problem.Assume I have a website that allows user registrations, so multiple users are able to sign up.How can I ensure individuals are signing up only once. In other words, 10 registrations = 10 new users, not 10 registrations = 5 new users with multiple accounts, 2 each.That challenge, making it so that one person gets 1 account only - how can that be resolved?The first attempt to prevent this can be limiting your verification vector, so a mandatory rule that each user must provide some form of authentication to be validated. ie. Drivers license, Birth Certificate, email address, SS#/SIN, phone number, IP address, MAC address, photo ID, and so on...Let's assume that identifying the users real name and/or identity is not required or wanted. What vectors for authentication do you really have???Is there a way to do this with Bitcoin/Ethereum. I have been rationalizing perhaps a cryptocurrency that can do issuance of tokens in a limited supply to wallets, but that doesn't stop the user from having multiple wallets.As far as I can think, I can't rationalize a solution, and while using government issued ID is the common solution with Bitcoin businesses, it's neither required nor wanted by the theoretical site I'm talking about.So any thoughts?TLDR: How do you solve the problem of multiple users signing up and creating multiple accounts. Is there a way, cryptographically or otherwise for a site to allow registrations so a user can only have 1 account and never more?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30c1v8/can_we_help_to_solve_an_age_old_fundamental/

"March 26, 2015 at 06:24PM",idontknowhowreddit,"So, am I wrong about this alt coin?","Here is a post that I commented on. I mined some nyancoins when it all started for fun. Besides, a few alt coins have, at least for a little while, been very profitable. I sold a lot of them off while they were worth anything, tipped a lot away, but still have some in a backup wallet.Anyway, I see that someone has 25% of all coins and come to my own conclusion that any doubt of the coins death I had were now gone. I make a quick, but unnecessary post pointing out that I feel it's bad news and then find op screaming at me. Turns out they are also a mod.This seems like an obvious move to hope to be a crypto millionaire for the wrong reasons. A key goal of cryptocurrencies is for everything to be decentralized, and where as op has every right to have as many of the coins as he/she wants, anyone else looking around for coins to invest in/play around with should see that as effectively the same as being a premined coin. There is one person who aims to gain a lot if others start dropping money into the pot, and all the others have a huge risk of losing a lot in exchange.I'm just curious if my thinking here is wrong, but the op there was obviously not mature enough to bother trying to have a conversation. I know there are some heavy investors in Bitcoin, but to my (poor) knowledge it's nothing like a quarter of the pool. If that's not the case, how would people feel if someone did? Or likewise if there is an individual or group with that sort of investment, how do people come to accept that?My thoughts were that Bitcoin has so far stood the test of time, whereas the other coin mentioned has lost a lot of its following, as well as being a relatively nonserious coin to begin with. Then it comes to be seen that one person takes credit for pretty much anything that resembles some sort of life and it's easy to see its someone's pet project that they need to see work out. Bitcoin has been accepted by a large number of people, whether or not those people feel positively about it.I don't know, I just found it sort of funny I guess. In the early days of that coin it was sort of like doge, where we were all goofing around, but it quickly turned into a sort of ""doge made people a lot of money, why not us?"" and I jumped ship, but watched what was going on since. After being attacked by a moderator I decided it was finally time to unsub, and then I got banned.So, TL;DR : was I wrong about someone (openly) owning 25% of a coin pool being a red flag?",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30d159/so_am_i_wrong_about_this_alt_coin/

"March 26, 2015 at 06:28PM",jeanduluoz,[X-Post] SEC allows small businesses to issue stock - time for colored coins?,"This seems to open up a world of possibilities. Does anyone have more info? See below.SEC Adopts Rules to Facilitate Smaller Companies’ Access to CapitalWashington D.C., March 25, 2015 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted final rules to facilitate smaller companies’ access to capital. The new rules provide investors with more investment choices. The new rules update and expand Regulation A, an existing exemption from registration for smaller issuers of securities. The rules are mandated by Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. The updated exemption will enable smaller companies to offer and sell up to $50 million of securities in a 12-month period, subject to eligibility, disclosure and reporting requirements.“These new rules provide an effective, workable path to raising capital that also provides strong investor protections,” said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. “It is important for the Commission to continue to look for ways that our rules can facilitate capital-raising by smaller companies.”The final rules, often referred to as Regulation A+, provide for two tiers of offerings: Tier 1, for offerings of securities of up to $20 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $6 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer; and Tier 2, for offerings of securities of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, with not more than $15 million in offers by selling security-holders that are affiliates of the issuer. Both Tiers are subject to certain basic requirements while Tier 2 offerings are also subject to additional disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements.The final rules also provide for the preemption of state securities law registration and qualification requirements for securities offered or sold to “qualified purchasers” in Tier 2 offerings. Tier 1 offerings will be subject to federal and state registration and qualification requirements, and issuers may take advantage of the coordinated review program developed by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). The rules will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30d1f3/xpost_sec_allows_small_businesses_to_issue_stock/

Everything seemed to work ok- I received funds via the online wallet from a coinbase wallet I have. After waiting for that transaction to be approved though, I tried to send the funds back to coinbase. I saved the transaction info file, transferred to the offline wallet via USB but then when I tried to import the file to the offline wallet I got the error: ""Electrum was unable to parse your transaction"". Tried all sorts of different ways to get it to work, but no dice.Also, as a possibly related question (maybe this is what is causing the error), how do you get received funds to show on the offline wallet? Is there someway that the two sync or is the offline wallet really just a way to sign and verify the transactions?Thanks in advance for any help!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30dps8/electrum_was_unable_to_parse_your_transaction/

I don't want my death to make you degenerates richer! I would prefer it make my family or people I care about, richer.Distributed keys! Multisig! You say.In March 2015 these are not solutions. Everyone can give me theoretical X-of-Y combinations but nobody can give me one practical X-of-Y multisig solution to ensure that my family or authorized people would be able to recover the funds, and how I would actually use this address to store my nest egg and spend with easily. Miner's won't even touch many of these M-of-N combinations yet. Nobody can tell me exactly how I would store the instructions.And also, I don't want authorized key holders to know the balance of the bitcoin I have available.I don't want to do some untested convoluted distributed treasure hunt for someone to combine the keys after I die!Or hire multiple lawyers to only own pieces of the keys.So the infrastructure just isn't there yet and I feel world is too random and risky to own a lot of this asset with the current software realities.I feel like cryptocurrency will solve these problems, like perhaps multisig in Monero where the participants don't even know the balance of the address because the blockchain is so opaque! Or something completely different on a higher software layer in BitcoinBut not right now.I'll trade COIN, and BIT, but as of today, even those aren't actually live, no liquidity.Enjoy the rollercoaster! When I want to obfuscate the origin of some funds I will go straight through the Monero network which I can use to pay bitcoin addresses and others through services like ShapeShift.io and XMR.to But right now I don't need to hold much of any cryptocurrency.tl;dr Cool story bro, and maybe there are things for you to consider as well",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30ewua/random_explosions_and_plane_crashes_one_reason_i/

I started trading btc for a few weeks and due to their low commission and simple interface, I was happy and transferred all my BTC from other markets to iGot.Decided I should trial a withdrawal before carrying on with all my eggs in one basket. Sold all BTC with intentions to withdraw my full $ balance to my bank account.Immediately after selling all my BTC my verification level was dropped to level 1 with no explanation. at level 1 you can not withdraw cash.I started a support ticket and emailed them and it took 7 days to clear it up and bring my verification level back to level 2 (allowing withdrawals).On 06.03.2015 I submitted a withdrawal request to cash out all my funds to my bank account.14 days pass and my withdrawal is still marked “pending”. In this time I sent iGot numerous emails and support tickets with not a single reply. So now I have no funds showing in my iGot account and no transfer has been made into my bank account. I have zero access. At this point i’m literally sickened with stress.On 20.03.2015 I get an email saying my withdrawal status has changed from “pending” to “confirmed” but funds are still not in my bank account. My support ticket is closed by iGot with no response or explanation.It’s now 27.03.2015. I still have no funds available in my iGot account or my bank account. I have sent daily emails and support tickets.This is a huge amount of money for me (and probably for most people).I am in Australia and so is iGot. I have provided them my bank details (confirmed with transfers), utility bills, credit card, drivers license, video call facial confirmation - the works. So this is not a security issue on their end.

"March 27, 2015 at 01:43PM",bubfranks,cryptocurrency in spaaaaace: a thought experiment,"I keep trying to figure out how to make a marscoin. The problem is that martians wouldn't be able to exchange value with each other very quickly. The vast majority of the hash power is on Earth, so martians have to transmit their transactions to Earth and wait for the blocks to come back. So however long it takes for n-confirmed transactions on Earth, martians have to wait between 10-40 minutes longer. Nobody got time for that. Martians could mine their own coin, but eventually the earthlings would take over the chain, and then you're back to the original problemThe best I can figure is we need to use the distance to our advantage. Let's assume there is a natural source of entropy that could be observed independently from multiple locations. Miners of marscoin must include the entropy in addition to the nonce to solve each block. Nodes would confirm the entropy actually happened along with the solution. Crucially, a shorter chain with more recent entropy would trump a longer chain with older entropy. This is important because every once in a while the martian miners would take too long to solve a block, giving time for an enterprising martian to send the entropy to Earth and receive a valid block in return. If the timing of the entropy didn't matter then Earth miners could then take over the chain. But martian miners have privileged access to the latest entropy, giving them a head-start over the earthlings in the race to the next block.I think this matters to cryptocurrencies on Earth because it's essentially a proof of location which could be useful in general.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30gu9p/cryptocurrency_in_spaaaaace_a_thought_experiment/

Pls realize that I am talking about a further out future solution for this.Using a decentralized storage solution, where everyone with a PC or even a mobile phone, possibly servers or really anything with storage, can host a small (or large or even complete) version of the blockchain.Every time someone spends from BTC, the protocol designates a small (say one-third or less) of the fee (so currently about a penny) will be proportionately distributed to everyone that has offered some amount of storage to host and maintain the blockchain.With millions of transactions that would take place, eventually there would be an economic incentive to host the blockchain or random parts of it. Across thousands of users, there would always be a complete copy of the blockchain even if it is split up into many pieces on a global community's distributed network.I am NOT a technical person, but is such an idea feasible with clever programming built into the protocol?

TOMORROW with the hackathon and conference!,"I am the chair of the Texas Bitcoin Conference which we put on here in Austin Texas in and about March every year. This will be our second conference.The Texas Bitcoin Conference seeks to be an open platform for Blockchain based technologies, the first and foremost being Bitcoin itself. Central to the promotion of the technology is the need to communicate sometimes very complex ideas. So this year we are publishing the first Proceedings of the Texas Bitcoin Conference. After the conference, we will publish the Web Version, with papers linked to the presentations of the authors. We will also give presenters an opportunity to submit written content to back their presentations if they wish to be included in the Web proceedings.The Conference runs a Hackathon where programmers will compete for over a million dollars in project support, consulting, and cryptocurrency. The Dapps Fund does contribute the most, and has this to say about the Hackaton.There are Limited Seats for the Hackathon! Less than 30 are left! Once the seats are gone, you will only be able to attend virtually. We will allow up to 100 virtual participants, but to attend virtually you will need to contact Support@TexasBitcoinConference.com, then connect with a team that is present in the hackathon.**I have a number of updates to make to the Agenda which I am pounding on now. Unfortunately I found out last night that IBM has pulled Sumabala P Nair as a speaker. Additionally due to circumstances beyond his control, Jason King will not attend.We are proud of the 50+ speakers and panelists that will drive the Texas Bitcoin Conference, and thank our sponsors for making this event possible.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30hmhb/the_texas_bitcoin_conference_starts_today_with/

"March 28, 2015 at 01:25AM",physicsbuddha,"Merchants, Please Offer a 5%+ Discount For Paying with Bitcoin","The biggest advantage, IMO, for merchants accepting Bitcoin is that they don't need to worry about chargebacks. Chargebacks can cost merchants a lot of money - depending on the merchant this can add up to 7% or more lost per average transaction (not to mention the time, etc wasted). So, I think at least for now, merchants should pass on some of those savings to customers who pay in Bitcoin. This could be different for each merchant but I think 5% sounds fair. But, if you normally lose 15% dealing with chargebacks, CC fees, etc - then maybe offer 10%. If you're just happy you aren't paying CC fees and only have a small problem with chargebacks ... offer a 4% discount.I think this could be really helpful because if merchants were offering 5-10%+ off ... people who have never heard of Bitcoin might buy Bitcoin just to save the 5-10% at their favorite merchant. And people who already hold Bitcoin would be a lot more likely to spend it (and hopefully buy more BTC) if they could save a significant amount. The ""lost"" revenue might also be completely covered due to increased numbers of orders from the (small, but often affluent) Bitcoin community.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30inz9/merchants_please_offer_a_5_discount_for_paying/
"March 28, 2015 at 01:22AM",bonerlickerz,Multisignature + Brain Wallet = Ultimate in Easy Security,"I've been using a brain wallet for a while now and just moved all my long-term deep-freeze cold storage coins into what I realized is a much better solution. I created a 7 of 7 multisig address and then created 7 easy to remember brain wallets to use as my 7 keys.This solves pretty much all the downsides of a brain wallet that most people complain about. The 7 things are super easy for me to remember so there is no chance of me ever forgetting what they are. A brute force/dictionary attack becomes completely infeasible as it would need to crack seven separate keys while simultaneously trying to verify every single potential combination of seven keys that it creates.This opens up a lot of phrases that were already useless. For instance, with a single brain wallet you would be a total idiot to try and use a line from your favorite song, no matter how obscure, because the brute/dictionary attacks will figure it out.. only a matter of time. But now you could take a whole verse of that same song.. split it up into maybe 8 lines .. create 8 brain wallet addresses .. and combine them into one ulta-high security multisig address.I just think it's pretty damn awesome how, over time, my bitcoins are becoming more and more secure.

"March 28, 2015 at 05:02AM",frankenmint,[shower thoughts] Could Bitcoin be an evolutionary adaption of Monetary value seeking to embrace and reinforce the concept of Globalization?,"Certainly, it could just be tin-foil hattery (if you think so, then call me out on that and give me the holes in reasoning please).I'm remembering how back in 2005 the issue of 'racing to the bottom' was a continued subject of interest in the news media. Many of us remember NAFTA and the backlash it caused amongst blue collar which then transitioned to grey collar workers stateside.Looking at Bitcoin from a purely critical standpoint, would it not also be in the better interest for any government actors (NA or EU or BRICS or even just individual nations) to PRETEND to dismiss bitcoin as a 'non-backed, valueless currency substitute', like a sleight of hand, while also conversely building up infrastructure?The flood of VC funded Exchanges and remittance services comes to mind - the interesting read about Changetip yesterday and how companies DO have information as a commodity that can be for sale also seems warranted when we're talking about the potential repercussions of a government entity attempting to strong-arm its way into ownership of the previously private infrastructure. (Yes, I feel that article could be considered overtly biased against Changetip but the writer raised logically valid points and I appreciated the read.)While it may be true that these are private ventures, would it not also make sense for the governments hosting these businesses to turn around (once market conditions seem prime to do so) and to simply take over and regulate these Bitcoin exchanges under the guise that its a global currency and thus is required to be under the purview of the Federal Reserve?Hypothetically speaking, if I were the USA (an entire nation and government) - wouldn't it be in my best interests to lie about Bitcoin and allow it to placate all traditional sovereign fiat currencies, knowing that my ultimate plan is to hold controlling interest over a majority of the nodes, mining power, and exchanges?

There's ""How To"" sex videos, porn reviews, relationship advice, a blog about my day-to-day life, news articles...all sorts of stuff!I have gotten numerous requests to accept Bitcoin on my site, and I think I've finally got it up and running. However, I can't really test it like I can with credit card payment processing software. I was wondering if I could get some help!If you are at all interested in sex/porn and have a few bits to spare it would be awesome if you processed a small transaction in Bitcoin on my site. Once you've performed the transaction you can then send me an e-mail letting me know if the transaction went smoothly and if there's anything you think should be done differently. I want to make sure that when people pay with Bitcoin they are getting a similar experience as the people who use traditional payment methods do. If you have the ability to screencast and can send me a video of your transaction from ""add to cart"" to ""payment complete"", that would be awesome.As an incentive for participating in this, anyone who makes a purchase in Bitcoin will get a link to download everything I currently sell. That would be 6 videos as of right now: 3 porns, 2 how-to videos, and one behind-the-scenes video, all in 1080p MP4's. So just buy one of the cheap videos for $3.00 USD, and I'll send you everything else for free. Of course, you have to pay in Bitcoin for this to work!After I get a few transactions and I know things are going well I'll take this post down. So if you're reading this, I still need your help!Thanks so much for reading and (possibly) participating!The NSFW website: www.Sexpressed.com My e-mail: scott@sexpressed.com",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30jtrp/looking_for_bitcoin_transaction_beta_testers_nsfw/

The difficulty will for the most part will continue getting higher.

"March 28, 2015 at 10:32AM",finnSquared,Coinbase delays,"Just thought I'd share my first encounter with some friction in the world of Bitcoin.Earlier this evening, I made a purchase from a merchant using the Shopify platform which is connected to his Coinbase account. As a Coinbase user myself, I though it'd be neat to use my login to pay for my order. This is where the trouble began.After timing out, my order had not been processed and the transaction had gone directly to my Coinbase account. I had sent 0.718 BTC and had nothing to show for it. With a knot in my stomach, I began opening lines of communication with the merchant and with Coinbase. Coinbase tells me to contact the merchant and the merchant tells me to contact Coinbase (shocking, I know). And to turn the anxiety up another notch, the address that the payment processor gave me is one that the merchant was not familiar with. After about two hours, and a dozen frantic emails, the broadcast finally goes through, but it's marked with a status of ""expired"" and as a mispayment? Two oddities that the customer service rep could not adequately explain to me. I've sent the transaction details to the merchant so that he can verify/track the situation. So at this point I'm pretty pissed that what should have been a simple and painless process has turned into a big pain in my ass.With all that said, I'm curious about what actually happened. Is the address one that the payment processor dynamically generated to handle the transaction? And why did the transaction take so long to broadcast to the network? I've never had a problem like this before.To supplement my story, here are the transaction details:https://blockchain.info/address/1Q6PuxuoFLQFhWN7W9HTfb5nSgGLyxgGHu?sort=0https://blockchain.info/tx/b47399ca5e2c9482aa2895c5348ab75c2aad776d5e237e42f6b09a29a08b3589",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30kf9u/coinbase_delays/

"March 28, 2015 at 02:13PM",Fergulati,Do people want a currency or convenience?,"I've been coining for a while. At this point I'm not sure if average citizens of any nation want true currency or just convenience. Using Bitcoin is inconvenient; however, the satisfaction of using a currency that is outside of a singular nation's control is tantalizing, I love it. When I discuss this notion with my friends and loved ones they only ask me questions that try to corner Bitcoin into the same framework as our current fiat system...I assume they want this framework due to its convenience. After two years of using both USD and BTC, I think the only route to true adoption will be convenience. People mindlessly use their debit/credit cards everyday. Spend cash and withdraw funds...mindlessly. Myself included. When a bill comes to my table my first instinct is to reach for my debit card. Why? Behavioral training I suppose. Until BTC is so easy to use that it overcomes that behavioral training or adopts it...mass use will be a farsighted and improbable goal. I think this currency is amazing. Even though it irks me about its origins, I still believe the math in motion can overcome that uncomfortableness. In my country, swiping plastic cards is ubiquitous with handing pretty papers. In my opinion BTC needs to take one of these forms before it can hope to shift how the masses view currency.Centuries of behavioral training through paper currency, and decades of behavioral training through plastic cards aren't going to erode quickly because a few hundred thousand smarties with foresight say that they should.My theory: BTC debit cards and salaries will be the rocket fuel...and then masses will be comfortable printing paper wallets (aka pretty paper currency). And, then the masses begin to understand viable currency from politically pedestaled currency.People are above governments...I trully believe that people are above governing bodies. I think governing bodies' main goal is to be over and above other governing bodies. With this precedent, if massive droves of individuals start to use BTC debit cards, then their governments won't get in their way when the majority of their constituents say, ""We like and want to use BTC. It's easy, secure, and just like cash but better.""Maybe I'm bonkers, but I think the true Trojan Horse characteristics of BTC are its abilities to be programmed so that pretty plastic cards can debit from Bitcoin addresses. A few years of comfortable behavioral will spark curiosity. And, curiosity is the catalyst of concrete learning.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30kwo0/do_people_want_a_currency_or_convenience/

"March 28, 2015 at 04:49PM",berrra,My experience with setting up a full node + questions,"Hello Reddit,As the title says I've just set up a full node and wanted to tell you about the experience I've had with it. This first part will cover some background stuff.It all started about a week ago when I first learned about what a full node actually was, and I was a little bit shocked I havn't learned about nodes earlier. I've been interested in bitcoin and the blockchain for years now and this whole segment for some reason has just been hidden right in front of me amongst these other focuses from ""media"" on wallet security, mining, elliptic curve cryptography etc.As I read up on the few articles/youtube-vids regarding nodes I could find, and that the supply of full nodes were declining, I figured I had to set up my own full node. Everything just fitted so perfectly. I have a NAS at home running 24/7 with a high speed connection and I would happily support the network.At this point I wanted to learn what exactly a full node was as I've previously just assumed this was something that was embedded in the mining process, because lots of people are doing that right? And for some reason there are ""only"" roughly 7000 full nodes out there right now. So I found some information that gave a basic understranding on what nodes did and I decided to set it up.I was informed to download a torrent containing bootstrap.dat, a packed collection of the first 200k blocks or so to speed up the process. But it isn't the first 200k blocks that takes time. It's the remaning 150k. Blocks 200.000 through ~350.000 has taken me roughly 6 days to process. The hardware is by no means performance heavy, like I said it's a NAS. The CPU is an old Intel Celeron 1.6 GHz.I guess this is a good time to start with the questions:From the long time it took to complete the blockchain I guess that every block is verified and not just downloaded and thus took quite the time to complete with a slow CPU. Will the size of the blockchain become a significant problem in the future? What solutions are there to this?What data is sent between nodes and how is this coordinated? Could nodes be tampered with to be harmful to the network? Lets say a company owns 99% of the nodes, what problem could come out of this?Going back to the issue with the decline in full nodes, I can honestly say that the only reason I havn't set up a full node earlier is because I wasn't even aware of it's existance and function. As a hobbyist I feel I should know this but I can only blame it has fallen between the cracks. I couldnt honestly even find a decent youtube video explaining the concept of a full node.Are you running a full node or perhaps several? What are your experiences?Sorry this thread turned into a rant. Yes I have port 8333 open :)EDIT: Spelling",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30l55v/my_experience_with_setting_up_a_full_node/

"March 29, 2015 at 05:42AM",Sentinelrv,Around 4 Days Left to Purchase Equity in Teehe Sports Book &amp; Casino DAO (Extensive FAQ Inside),"There are now around 4 days left to purchase equity in Teehe Sports Book & Casino. Below I've compiled a Q&A list, along with links to even more info. If you'd like to buy Peershares, then check the main website for contact info. Of note is the fact that this project is headed up by the creator of Peerbox, an operating system designed for securely running nodes and minting Peercoins. The creator (Peerchemist) is a well known and reputable figure in the Peercoin community.Important Links:Teehe.netProspectusBusiness PlanMore Expansive Q&A ThreadHow are you dealing with the legal aspects of this?First and foremost Teehe is not illegal; however precautions have been made with foresight of legislative changes to cryptocurrency, crowdfunding, and online gambling. As much as legal entities are concerned we do not exist. We only exist in form of DAO. Ownership is decentralized and anonymous.This must be illegal in United States of America.Contrary to popular belief online gambling is not illegal in the United States, merely the money transmission process to online gambling companies has been outlawed by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006.There is no way for government to seize funds or credit card company to block money transfers as we use cryptocurrency. We handle USD without handling Fiat, thanks to NuBits, which is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the dollar. The Nu Network was created 6 months ago and has maintained their peg to the dollar, at times generating millions of dollars in trading volume and consistently being listed in the top 10 or top 3 on CoinMarketCap.com in terms of volume.Can’t managers just steal IPO funds and never deliver the product?IPO funds are kept in multisig wallet among managers and one neutral party, a well known Nu and Peercoin community member who is chosen for good reputation. Even if managers of Teehe want to steal the funds, they can’t. That is the design.Why is it better to raise money through Peershares than from traditional VCs?Funding raised through traditional venture capital firms eliminates anonymity. Furthermore, an elimination of anonymity is a point of failure for the organization if legislation were to negatively shift in either the cryptocurrency or gambling industry. In this regard, Teehe management has the foresight to raise funds in an anonymous fashion through Peershares, to prevent third party intervention in the future. Peershares also allows for profit earned to be distributed via dividends among shareholders, plus the ability for shareholders to influence Teehe through decentralized motion voting.Teehe is structured to be resilient to attacks from legal entities by its ownership structure in the form of a Peershares DAO, which allows it to circumvent high taxes, regulatory costs and forms of censorship. There is no way for governments to seize funds or credit card companies to block money transfers. There is no way for any government or bank to influence Teehe. That is the design. It is important to say that the only contact point of Teehe with the ""real world"" is dividends sold for fiat by our shareholders. If shareholders can do this without government interference, then they will remain 100% safe and anonymous.How will Teehe match upcoming projects that are implementing decentralized gambling on the blockchain?While these truly decentralized solutions are quite interesting from technical perspective, we consider they lack practicality. They are often over-engineered and lack scalability, stability and security. That is why we have chosen not to pursue this kind of approach and use tested and reliable technologies. This does not mean we will not strive to technically evolve in the future. We think we are in far better position to experiment with new technologies as money making business than startup running on investor’s money.What value does non-volatile betting provide the customer?Bitcoin has continued to grow in the consciousness of its users. However, people still predominantly rationalize their monetary portfolios in terms of Fiat. The same applies to gambling, bettors wish to wager approximately $100 on a match, and not 0.34798 Bitcoin. We spare our customers of this mental conversion and allow them to bet in terms of their preferred Fiat currency.Volatility is a risk premium, meaning an investor requires a higher return on an investment due to volatility. The volatility swings with Bitcoin are not small either, especially over a long term perspective, so Bitcoin gamblers are taking large risks without being compensated. Teehe eliminates this risk premium, it is logical to conclude the market will come to favour such a solution.The biggest value is not even to the current Bitcoin gambling market. Teehe opens up this market to the massive traditional Fiat market. Teehe is a bridge between both of these markets. It captures all the benefits cryptocurrency has over Fiat that saw the rise in Bitcoin gambling, while solving the volatility problem that prevented a larger majority of users entering into Bitcoin gambling.The gambling industry is one that reacts to change quickly; it was one of the first industries to move operations to the internet, it was one of the first use cases of Bitcoin. The future of the online gambling market lies in non-volatile betting, low transaction fees, and instantaneous deposits/withdraws.Where did the name Teehe came from?The ancient Greek goddess Tyche. The personification of chance or luck, the Fortuna of the Romans, a daughter of Zeus the Liberator.Adapted to English language and modern demographics.How does Teehe compare with classic online betting sites and casinos?Teehe solves a lot of problems that customers experience with classic online betting sites that accept Fiat currency. Gamblers are accustomed to gamble with Fiat, whether USD or Euro. We handle USD without handling Fiat, thanks to NuBits. Moreover, Bitcoin takes role of credit card operator with Teehe as it can be used as mean of money transfer from customer to Teehe or vice versa. By not using Fiat currency we solve following problems:• Money deposit/withdrawal feesCredit card company will take fee, PayPal/Skrill will take a fee, gambling house will take a fee. Those can reach up to 20 USD on each transfer in any direction. Most of people gamble with less than 50 USD at the time. So they lose up to 50% of their stake just to transfer the money.• Money transmission delaysIt will take up to two days to get your money to gambling house, even more if you need to withdraw.• Fiat to Fiat conversion feesMost of gambling houses accept Euro/US Dollar. If customer uses another currency, credit card company or PayPal/Skrill will rob you on conversion rate.• Easy taxation on behalf of authoritiesAuthorities ignore small time players. However if you score big win, like 5-10-20k Euro governments will try to tax it. Sometime taking as much as 50%. With Fiat you can not hide this money, with cryptcurrency you can.• Total loss of privacyYour bank, credit card company and goverment can track your activity easily.• Seizure of customers funds by bank or credit card company.This happens sometimes, you can read about it on gambling/betting forums. For no obvious reasons credit card company or PayPal will just take your funds and keep them for months as you try to get it back hopelessly.What do we solve? All of the above. We handle USD without handling Fiat, thanks to NuBits.

"March 29, 2015 at 06:42AM",SimonBelmond,We need a standard for Bitcoin blockchain timestamps! Proposal Inside! Feedback please!,"Dear Bitcoiners and BitcoinerettesI have recently found great interest in using the Bitcoin blockchain for secure and trustless timestamping. This interest was mainly raised as I would have loved to have proof of certain data I and others produced in the past. I am not in the situation to need the proof now, but It could have come in handy one day. I previously asked on reddit about advice regarding creation of an email plugin which would keep timestamps for all my emails. I imagined this plugin to timestamp based on certain filter criteria.The reactions on reddit were quite negative: Too expensive, too much bloat, blockchain spam. At the time I was discouraged and let it slip away as it seemed unfeasible.I started to study the current implementations and services and created this overview:Bitcoin Blockchain Timestamping OverviewI have no affiliation with any of these and I have also not tried all of these services!After studying these concepts which I found, I came to several conclusions:There is no Bitcoin blockchain timestamping standard so far. Every implementation is somewhat different.There are some methods which are susceptible to pruning. These might have a problem in the future.There are some methods which use more space in the blockchain than others. Bloat is of course not desired.I think we are in need of a standard which will be used more often. Only if we have a standard which lots of users follow, Bitcoin timestamps can be widely used and accepted. Just imagine a court case where someone claims to have such a timestamp. Technical experts will have to be called in to state that this is in fact as close to proof as it gets that the timestamp was in fact made prior to date X. Now if everyone does it differently, everyone will have to pay for their own experts and it will take much longer until these timestamps are accepted plus it will overall be more expensive to get them accepted, if there are several predominant types. If we follow a standard these timestamps could get a certain credibility amongst non-technical people and would be accepted much faster.So what would be ideal requirements for such a standard?No blockchain bloatMinimal data which has to be stored along with the document or document’s hash.Make use of standard crypto operationsNo need to run a full node or be mining in order to make a timestampClient side hashing of the data to make the level of privacy configurable by the user.Not susceptibility to pruningTimestamp validity can be checked immediately by participant. Immediate client side verification.From these requirements I figured the following concept would be best:Document’s SHA-256 hash is created.Other Document’s SHA- 256 hashes are collected (3rd party, self or both)A Merkle tree is created out of all the collected hashes.The top hash is RIPE160ed and made directly into an address (add prepend version, checksum, Base58 encode)A single Satoshi is sent to the addressTX hash is fed back (or kept in case of self) to user.Together with the TX hash the Merkle tree branch is fed back (and/or kept in case of self) to the user.To verify A timestamp needs the following:Original data (SHA-245 hash can be derived)Bitcoin transaction hash (block number can be derived)Merkle tree branchActually it was /u/sipa who pointed me to ChronoBit (in the list mentioned above) and making use of of Merkle trees to reduce bloat. My proposal as pointed out above derives from the concept of CronoBit in that it still creates a transaction. However, it borrows the concept of the hash tree from CronoBit and I guess from Bitcoin itself too ;-)While ChronoBit is fully p2p and decentralized it bears the problem that you either need to be mining yourself, or rely on others to be mining for you. It is elegant as you have a direct connection to the block hash and no additional transactions are needed.I am look at using a one Satoshi transaction for x timestamps is like forging a little unspendable colored coin which serves as anchor point for many timestamp participants.A single stamper (private or service) can literally create thousands of timestamps in a daily transaction. The client must store a little bit more data compared to single timestamp models. That is not an awful lot of data even for thousands of documents; e.g. 1500 digits proof per document (including some identifiers) would suffice to join forces and have 250’000 timestamps in one transaction.I guess the standard needs to be as flexible as possible. The format must be similar to PGP signatures or so. Something like: {document’s hash; transaction hash, Merkle tree branch depth, Merkle tree branch hashes, claimed blocktime of verified block}I like the concept because it would enable a fully dynamic level of self crated Merkle tree and service created Merkle tree. Can either be done on top of own full Bitcoin node, or with a service. If a service is used the hash tree can still be continued. The service can do nothing but fool you for some minutes. There are no privacy issues as only hashes are sent in the first place. After the service created and sent the proof, it can vanish without the timestamp being lost for the user; 3rd party trust will not be a critical thing for most users.I also want to discuss the way the address is created in my proposal above. Some current implementations create a private key first and then derive the address from it. This makes the transacted Satoshi potentially prunable. Someone could spend it with the private key which is commonly known. I want that Satoshi stuck forever.With this scheme I think it would be feasible to timestamp as many emails and documents as I want without having huge costs and the bloat is somewhat justifiable...After your valued feedback I would like to try to put together a paper and some kind of demo implementation.BestSimonBelmondThings which are not entirely clear to me:Transaction hashes, malleability and if it matters in this context.More methods/services for timestamping if you know of any.I did read that some miners do not include OP_RETURN transactions any more. How likely is it that this will become a problem in the future?I am not all that knowledgeable about pruning, so if someone could point out what is really relevant for timestamping, I would be happy.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30ndi6/we_need_a_standard_for_bitcoin_blockchain/

They provide a great service. Sure, they charge exorbitant fees to businesses, but to consumers it helps soooo much.The security and peace of mind i feel when keeping my money in a bank is not soon to be outdone by the security I feel in holding all my money in some private keys. Sure you could argue that either its a false sense of security or that someday it might change, but right now that's the way it is. The general public hears bitcoin and thinks scheme and scam. How long will that sentiment hold? This will change in the future. Be honest with ourselves now.Additionally the transactional system that banks have set up is expansive and mostly seemless. While companies in the bitcoin space are making up ground, its going to take a long while.Banks are not the enemy! Sure, banks fucked us over and they will do it again. On the other side of that coin, how many have personally lost money in bitcoin due to an exchange collapsing or someone running off with their coin or lost private key or sending to the wrong address, etc. (Me!) People fuck up and fuck other people over.The real win here is to prevent governments from printing more money. That's it. If banks integrate bitcoin into their processing it will help them reduce their fees. I'm all for it. I'm not soon to abandon my bank, its the way it is for me and I'm guessing a whole lot of you too. I want banks to embrace bitcoin and to secure my bitcoin properly so I don't have to.

I just woke up and noticed a couple people had contributed BTC while I'd slept and figured we'd keep giving away gift cards until funds run out again. The last time we did this it lasted over 7+ days and we were able to help a whole lot of people. The gift card company Gyft wrote us and contributed more than $1,000 dollars to our Merry Bitcoin Gyft account and wrote a nice article about what we were doing on their website, we also had a handful of nice donations from the Bitcoin community, in total we ended up giving away well over $3,000+ dollars worth of gift cards to Burger King, CVS, Pizza Hut and the like to those who needed a bit of extra help during the holidays.To see some of what we did last year we'd created this video at the time to better explain Bitcoin to those who were curious and demonstrate what we were doing: Merry Bitcoin! Could anyone use a little help or a good sandwich?Also, to see the original thread from last year that started it all and that ended with over 500+ requests: (Original Post) Who could use a little help?We were unfortunately too busy with work during the holidays this year to run Merry Bitcoin during the holidays as we had in the past. We had some free time this weekend and started giving gift cards away last night for the fun of it, then we woke up to notice a couple of individuals had made BTC donations so we decided to continue again until we run out of Bitcoin.We had a lot of fun doing this last year, the mods are pinning our posts again in both /r/randomactsofpizza and /r/random_acts_of_pizza so that we stay on their front pages and we'll go until we're out of the money that we've set aside + any other BTC that's contributed.If anyone here would like to contribute, the BTC address we'll be using is the same as last year...Merry Bitcoin BTC Address: 1MzUXkMbXFopNdhfidcEVQbBpudN6e9YpiWhen we ran Merry Bitcoin last year the exchange rate was around $750 dollars to 1 BTC, which meant 250 BKW (Burger King Whoppers) per Bitcoin.

So long story short, after a bunch of searching around on how to get bitcoins (because I always just wanted some), I was directed to localbitcoin dotcom. First post I saw was someone accepting amazon giftcards for bitcoin. Having no experience with western union or moneygram I thought this was a good idea for me. I also noticed that there was four previous transactions and he/she had 100% feedback. (I soon found out that that wasn't a lot.) The description or whatever for the transaction said to text at said number. First mistake. Then after some conversation just sent him the gift card codes. Second Mistake. Then the activation receipt trusting him way to much. Third mistake. The account was then deleted and he won't text me back.

Part of the reason for our mistake is that we rushed through this, trying to get all 800 devices assembled, flashed, and packed in two days, so we didn't shove them into the foam holders as tightly as needed, resulting in some of them coming loose and rattling around, we stuck all the stickers on the flat side of the box instead of the grooved front, only later realizing that with the soft plastic case you can lift one side of the box without breaking the seal, and using the first available cheapest packing we had that was the minimum required for shipping something like this (at least in Europe). For US/Canada customers, I made sure to seat the devices tightly into the foam holder, ran my fingernail over the stickers to make sure they stuck well, and used sturdier packaging, which is why it took me a bit over a week to ship them all out, instead of just two days. Despite this we still had reports with them being opened on the way to Canada, or even the plastic boxes being cracked or crushed despite being wrapped in a T-shirt.In the next batch, we'll ship them in sturdier packaging, put the sticker on the drive cap instead of the box, so customs can see it's just a USB device without cracking the seal when they open the box, and so the seal isn't as easily broken during shipping, and will declare them as ""Engineering sample"" or something else as innocuous. That said...Stickers are the least important security features in these. If all we had to depend on was a sticker, we would have failed miserably at security. When we first publicly anounced these devices last summer, we had everyone from Peter Todd to less known but even more security conscious people chew us out for having REALLY crappy initial security ideas, with a ton of examples of how it can be attacked. We listened and implemented all of the ideas we were given, both for hardware and software,which accounted for at least 2.5 months of the delays. Now, the devices include multiple entropy/RNG sources, restrictions to only accepting being flashed with signed firmware as well as other internal protections, and for extra security have the option to add Diceware salt to your key, with a hash you can use to verify that its being used and is thus secure. With that salt and hash, even if the whole device is completely compromised, the attacker would still not be able to steal your keys. If all you could depend on for keeping these secure was that you were the only one who touched it, you wouldn't be able to lend it to anyone either, and we would have felt embarrassed about our shameful levels of ""security."" Basically, these were designed with the mindset that you shouldn't be able to (or have to) trust even us, the actual developers, and still feel safe with your keys. This is the same goal we have for our Mycelium Wallet, where we want you to rely on our public code and implementation methods to trust that your keys are secure and private, not just on our say so.",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30o9b5/mycelium_entropy_broken_seals_were_really_sorry/

"March 29, 2015 at 06:54PM",saint_quistgard,"[PSA] Investigating Agora wallets; cold stash of at least 24,000 BTC (x-post with /r/DarknetMarkets)","Hey all,I've been using Wallet Explorer to investigate Agora's wallets, and I've found some intriguing/concerning stuff.Around 24,000 BTC accumulating in Agora-controlled addressesThere are currently around 23,960 BTC sitting in storage addresses that appear to be controlled by Agora. The bulk of this money seems to be drawn from Agora deposit addresses in large chunks, so it doesn't appear to be standard market fees. And most of the storage addresses are basically receive-only, so it's unlikely they have any operational use. Also, the hoarding seems to have accelerated in recent months.For example, after being funded with 536.8 BTC of Agora money on 11/25/14, this address has been receiving 50 BTC chunks regularly since 12/5/14: http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1923qxU74HWWz75LgWTsPE4FT9Zyd6n6bv. It's balance is currently 14636.8468236. Here's a similar address with a balance of 2350: http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/152p1VPp2UYceP9BLtJRLoMgoErQRCryTt.Other storage addresses that seem to be controlled by Agora:http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1GE26MHLB3pvtQdV9BFtfPc7tD12b72NtE (2393.10046)http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1AtPMyFrbjvEAZyAHvkQ5SBNyou33m5Eft (1730.00001)http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/18p3VadubeccpJnhBQkyrbs6SQPN5WCf8J (1950)http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/152p1VPp2UYceP9BLtJRLoMgoErQRCryTt (2350)http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/18vssbRHFbSrDttAAg9tX1TtwSvUyCKJwd (900)http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/17DhzPwQLvpoB1xy1mSt2XTCFmePgGUh2rhttp://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1CG4oDeiDcm5QSQhbXmfLmPzdZGANymaxSI'd like to see what percentage of Agora deposits is going to these storage addresses (to determine whether whether it's reasonable profit taking or something more nefarious) but Wallet Explorer doesn't offer a way to filter by incoming transactions. Anyone have a program that can do that? Also, some of the activity in these addresses seems to coincide with downtime in late November (and the current downtime), so the timing is worth looking into further.Getting a little crazy now: Possible Agora-SR2 connection?This could use double checking, but it looks like substantial amounts of BTC were sent directly from Silk Road 2 to Agora's operators in the days and weeks leading up to the SR2 seizure.From 11/17/14 to 12/11/14, this address accumulated 568 BTC, mostly from known Agora addresses: http://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1MAqDMezJAe1Am4gcZhKc8etYJqSPBoRfD. (This activity looks very similar to the storage addresses discussed above.)On 12/17, the entire balance is spent in this transaction: http://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/9a9cf7a153bcf0eac837c7d5c82bd5ec7e803fc6331debd53090f7e4bbfc7a5f. If you check the other addresses spending coins in that TX, you'll see several of them received a bunch of money from SR2, mostly in 30 BTC chunks during late Oct and early Nov. So whoever owns the 1MAqD... address (looks like it might be Agora) also owns the addresses receiving money from SR2 just prior to its fall.Of course I could be interpreting this wrong (and Wallet Explorer could be wrong!), so if anyone wants to take a look and share your thoughts, I'd appreciate it.This is all I have time for at the moment, but I have a bunch of notes on this stuff so can provide more info when I get a chance later.

If they have an account with said bank, the merchants get even deeper discounts.Visa? Mastercard? Y'all listening? JP Morgan? Don't you like money? Let's do this.One world currency... It's happening, and it's not the dollar.Meanwhile my online bank tools show me the relative return of my paycheck paid via local currency vs. It's growth as pure bitcoin.Because there's no 'interest' in the bitcoin universe, the bank has no traditional savings accounts (except in name only), nor do they particularly care if they hold a large amount of bitcoin. They make their money on transaction fees, and therefore have an incentive to convince their customers to make as many transactions as possible.Another possible incentive program would involve the bank rewarding customers with its own, in-house and centralized cryptocurrency that can be used similar to how rewards points are earned today: discounts, free vacations, hotels, etc.Conversion into other licensed crypto assets would be painless and fast. Because of the ease of crypto, individuals would now have much lower barrier to entry if they wanted to own approved crypto stocks and funds (over thirty approved companies would have crypto stocks licensed through the SEC, with hundreds more on the way).Ahhh... I'm dreaming... For now. But this will be a reality eventually. But when? 2018? 2022?

Probably, on it's own (XRP) not that valuable.Why should a financial institution adopt bitcoin (with or without sidechains, coloured coins), or go for Ripple? Because Bitcoin has the largest network?Thanks for constructive feedbacks!",,/r/Bitcoin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/30paam/bitcoin_vs_ripple/
